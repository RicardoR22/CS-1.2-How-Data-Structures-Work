Easy, boy.
What do you expect?
They’re savages.
One lot steals a goat from another lot, before you know it they’re ripping each other to pieces.
I’ve never seen wildlings do a thing like this I never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life.
How close did you get?
Close as any man would.
We should head back to the Wall.
Do the dead frighten you?
Our orders were to track the wildlings.
We tracked them.
They won’t trouble us no more.
You don’t think he’ll ask us how they died?
Get back on your horse.
Whatever did it to them could do it to us.
They even killed the children.
It’s a good thing we’re not children.
You want to run away south, run away.
Of course, they will behead you as a deserter.
If I don’t catch you first.
Get back on your horse.
I won’t say it again.
Your dead men seem to have moved camp.
They were here.
See where they went.
What is it?
It’s…
Go on, Father’s watching.
And your mother.
Fine work, as always.
Well done.
Thank you.
I love the detail that you’ve managed to get in these corners.
Quite beautiful.
The stitching…
Oh, no, no, no.
This stitch is very…
It’s beautiful.
Thank you.
And which one of you was a marksman at ten?
Keep practicing, Bran.
Go on.
Don’t think too much, Bran.
Relax your bow arm.
Quick, Bran!
Faster.
Lord Stark!
My lady.
A guardsman just rode in from the hills.
They’ve captured a deserter from the Night’s Watch.
Get the lads to saddle their horses.
Do you have to?
He swore an oath, Cat.
Law is law, my lady.
Tell Bran he’s coming too.
Ned.
Ten is too young to see such things.
He won’t be a boy forever.
And winter is coming.
Good lad, go run back and get the rest.
White walkers.
I saw the white walkers.
White walkers.
The white walkers, I saw them.
I know I broke my oath.
And I know I’m a deserter.
I should have gone back to the Wall and warned them, but…
I saw what I saw.
I saw the white walkers.
People need to know.
If you can get word to my family…
tell them I’m no coward.
Tell them I’m sorry.
Forgive me, Lord.
In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the first of his name…
Don’t look away…
.
King of the Andals and the First Men…
Father will know if you do…
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die.
You did well.
You understand why I did it?
Jon said he was a deserter.
But do you understand why I had to kill him?
“Our way is the old way”?
The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
Is it true he saw the white walkers?
The white walkers have been gone for thousands of years.
So he was lying?
A madman sees what he sees.
What is it?
Mountain lion?
There are no mountain lions in these woods.
It’s a freak.
It’s a direwolf.
Tough old beast.
There are no direwolves south of the Wall.
Now there are five.
You want to hold it?
Where will they go?
Their mother’s dead.
They don’t belong down here.
Better a quick death.
They won’t last without their mother.
Right.
Give it here.
No!
Put away your blade.
I take orders from your father, not you.
Please, Father!
I’m sorry, Bran.
Lord Stark?
There are five pups.
One for each of the Stark children.
The direwolf is the sigil of your house.
They were meant to have them.
You will train them yourselves.
You will feed them yourselves.
And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.
What about you?
I’m not a Stark.
Get on.
What is it?
The runt of the litter.
That one’s yours, Snow.
As your brother,I feel it’s my duty to warn you…
you worry too much.
It’s starting to show.
And you never worry about anything.
When we were seven and you jumped off the cliffs at Casterly Rock, foot drop into the water…
you were never afraid.
There was nothing to be afraid of until you told Father.
“We’re Lannisters.
Lannisters don’t act like fools.
” What if Jon Arryn told someone?
But who would he tell?
My husband.
If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now.
Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn’t know, it died with him.
And Robert will choose a new Hand of the King, someone to do his job while he’s off fucking boars and hunting whores.
Or is it the other way around?
And life will go on.
You should be the Hand of the King.
That’s an honour I can do without.
Their days are too long, their lives are too short.
All these years, and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.
You have five northern children.
You’re not an outsider.
I wonder if the old gods agree.
It’s your gods with all the rules.
I am so sorry, my love.
Tell me.
There was a raven from King’s Landing.
Jon Arryn is dead.
A fever took him.
I know he was like a father to you.
Your sister, the boy?
They both have their health, gods be good.
The raven brought more news.
The king rides for Winterfell…
with the queen and all the rest of them.
If he’s coming this far north…
there’s only one thing he’s after.
You can always say no, Ned.
We’ll need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion’s chamber.
I’m told he reads all night.
I’m told he drinks all night.
How much could he possibly drink?
A man of his…
stature?
We’ve brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar.
Perhaps we’ll find out.
In any case, candles.
Why is your mother so dead set on us getting pretty for the king?
It’s for the queen, I bet.
I hear she’s a sleek bit of mink.
I hear the prince is a right royal prick.
Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.
Go on, Tommy, shear him good.
He’s never met a girl he likes better than his own hair.
Gods, but they grow fast.
Brandon!
I saw the king.
He’s got hundreds of people.
How many times have I told you?
No climbing.
But he’s coming right now, down our road.
I want you to promise me, no more climbing.
I promise.
Do you know what?
What?
You always look at your feetbefore you lie.
Run and find your father.
Tell him the king is close.
Where’s Arya?
Sansa, where’s your sister?
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Oh.
What are you doing with that on?
Go on.
Move!
Your Grace.
You’ve got fat.
Cat!
Your Grace.
Nine years…
Why haven’t I seen you?
Where the hell have you been?
Guarding the North for you, Your Grace.
Winterfell is yours.
Where’s the Imp?
Will you shut up?
Who have we here?
You must be Robb.
My, you’re a pretty one.
Your name is?
Arya.
Oh, show us your muscles.
You’ll be a soldier.
That’s Jaime Lannister,the queen’s twin brother.
Would you please shut up?
My queen.
My queen.
Take me to your crypt.
I want to pay my respects.
We’ve been riding for a month, my love.
Surely the dead can wait.
Ned.
Where’s the Imp?
Where is our brother?
Go and find the little beast.
Tell me about Jon Arryn.
One minute he was fine and then…
burned right through him,whatever it was.
I loved that man.
We both did.
He never had to teach you much,but me?
You remember me at ?
All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls.
He showed me what was what.
Aye.
Don’t look at me like that.
It’s not his fault I didn’t listen.
I need you, Ned,down at King’s Landing, not up here where you’re no damn use to anybody.
Lord Eddard Stark…
I would name you the Hand of the King.
I’m not worthy of the honour.
I’m not trying to honour you.
I’m trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink and whore my way to an early grave.
Damn it, Ned, stand up.
You helped me win the Iron Throne,now help me keep the damn thing.
We were meant to rule together.
If your sister had lived,we’d have been bound by blood.
Well, it’s not too late.
I have a son,you have a daughter.
We’ll join our houses.
It is true what they say about the northern girls.
Did you hear the king’s in Winterfell?
I did hear something about that.
And the queen and her twin brother.
They say that he is the most handsome manin the Seven Kingdoms.
And the other brother?
The queen has two brothers?
There’s the pretty one…
and there’s the clever one.
Mmm…
I hear they call him the Imp.
I hear he hates that nickname.
Oh?
I hear he’s more than earned it.
I hear he’s a drunken little lecher,prone to all manner of perversions.
Clever girl.
We’ve been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.
Have you?
Already?
Oh!
The gods gave me one blessing.
Don’t get up.
My lord.
Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?
You have much to teach me, no doubt,but our sister craves your attention.
She has odd cravings, our sister.
A family trait.
Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown.
Don’t leave me alone with these people.
I’m sorry, I’ve begun the feast a bit early.
And this is the first of many courses.
I thought you might say that.
But since we’re short on time…
Come on, girls.
See you at sundown.
Close the door!
Did you have to bury her in a place like this?
She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.
She was my sister.
This is where she belongs.
She belonged with me.
In my dreams,I kill him every night.
It’s done, Your Grace.
The Targaryens are gone.
Not all of them.
Daenerys!
Daenerys.
There’s our bride to be.
Look, a gift from Illyrio.
Touch it.
Go on, feel the fabric.
Mmm.
Isn’t he a gracious host?
We’ve been his guests for over a year and he’s never asked us for anything.
Illyrio’s no fool.
He knows I won’t forget my friends when I come into my throne.
You still slouch.
Let them see.
You have a woman’s body now.
I need you to be perfect today.
Can you do that for me?
You don’t want to wake the dragon, do you?
No.
When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister,they will say it began today.
It’s too hot, my lady.
Where is he?
The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.
Athchomar chomakaan, Khal vezhven.
May I present my honoured guests?
Viserys of House Targaryen,the third of his name,the rightful King of the Andals and the First Men,and his sister,Daenerys of House Targaryen.
Do you see how long his hair is?
When Dothraki are defeated in combat they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame.
Khal Drogo has never been defeated.
He’s a savage, of course,but he’s one of the finest killers alive.
And you will be his queen.
Come forward, my dear.
Where is he going?
The ceremony is over.
But he…
But he didn’t say anything.
Did he like her?
Trust me, Your Grace,if he didn’t like her, we’d know.
It won’t be long now.
Soon you will cross the narrow sea and take back your father’s throne.
The people drink secret toasts to your health.
They cry out for their true king.
When will they be married?
Soon.
The Dothraki never stay still for long.
Is it true they lie with their horses?
I wouldn’t ask Khal Drogo.
Do you take me for a fool?
I take you for a king.
Kings lack the caution of common men.
My apologies if I’ve given offence.
I know how to play a man like Drogo.
I give him a queen and he gives me an army.
I don’t want to be his queen.
I want to go home.
So do I.
I want us both to go home,but they took it from us.
So tell me, sweet sister,how do we go home?
I don’t know.
We go home with an army.
With Khal Drogo’s army.
I would let his whole tribe fuck you,all , men and their horses too,if that’s what it took.
Do you think Joffrey will like me?
What if he thinks I’m ugly?
Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.
He’s so handsome.
When would we be married?
Soon?
Or do we have to wait?
Hush now.
Your father hasn’t even said yes.
Why would he say no?
He’d be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.
He’d have to leave home.
He’d have to leave me.
And so would you.
You left your home to come here And I’d be queen someday.
Please make Father say yes!
Sansa…
Please, please!
It’s the only thing I ever wanted.
Fill that up!
Boys, Rodrik, come on.
Come on!
Come here, you little beauty!
Is he dead yet?
Uncle Benjen.
You got bigger.
Rode all day.
Didn’t want to leave you alone with the Lannisters.
Why aren’t you at the feast?
Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.
Well, you’re always welcome on the Wall.
No bastard was ever refused a seat there.
So take me with you when you go back.
Jon…
Father will let me if you ask him.
I know he will.
The Wall isn’t going anywhere.
I’m ready to swear your oath.
You don’t understand what you’d be giving up.
We have no families.
None of us will ever father sons.
I don’t care about that.
You might, if you knew what it meant.
I’d better get inside,rescue your father from his guests.
We’ll talk later.
Your uncle’s in the Night’s Watch.
What are you doing back there?
Preparing for a night with your family.
I’ve always wanted to see the Wall.
You’re Tyrion Lannister,the queen’s brother?
My greatest accomplishment.
And you, you’re Ned Stark’s bastard,aren’t you?
Did I offend you?
Sorry.
You are the bastard, though.
Lord Eddard Stark is my father.
And Lady Stark is not your mother,making you…
the bastard.
Let me give you some advice, bastard.
Never forget what you are.
The rest of the world will not.
Wear it like armour…
and it can never be used to hurt you.
What the hell do you know about being a bastard?
All dwarves are bastards in their father’s eyes.
You at a feast…
it’s like a bear in a trap.
The boy I beheaded…
did you know him?
Of course I did.
Just a lad.
But he was tough, Ned,a true ranger.
He was talking madness.
Said the walkers slaughtered his friends.
The two he was with are still missing.
Hmph.
A wildling ambush.
Maybe.
Direwolves south of the Wall,talk of the walkers,and my brother might bethe next Hand of the King.
Winter is coming.
Winter is coming.
Uncle Benjen.
Robb boy.
How are you?
I’m good.
Is this your first time in the North, Your Grace?
Yes.
Lovely country.
I’m sure it’s very grim after King’s Landing.
I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time.
Hello, little dove.
But you are a beauty.
How old are you?
Thirteen, Your Grace.
You’re tall.
Still growing?
I think so, Your Grace.
And have you bled yet?
No, Your Grace.
Your dress, did you make it?
Such talent.
You must make something for me.
I hear we might share a grandchild someday.
I hear the same.
Your daughter will do well in the capital.
Such a beauty shouldn’t stay hidden up here forever.
Your pardon.
I hear we might be neighbours soon.
I hope it’s true.
Yes, the king has honoured me with his offer.
I’m sure we’ll have a tournament to celebrate your new title, if you accept.
It would be good to have you on the field.
The competition has become a bit stale.
I don’t fight in tournaments.
No?
Getting a little old for it?
I don’t fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real,I don’t want him to know what I can do.
Well said.
Arya!
It’s not funny!
She always does this.
This was my favourite dress and she ruined it.
She always does it and it’s not funny!
Time for bed.
I’m a Northman.
I belong here with you, not down southin that rats’ nest they call a capital.
I won’t let him take you.
The king takes what he wants.
That’s why he’s king.
I’ll say, “Listen, fat man.
” “You are not taking my husband anywhere.
” He belongs to me now.
” How did he get so fat?
He only stops eating when it’s time for a drink.
It’s Maester Luwin, my lord.
Send him in.
Pardon, my lord, my lady.
A rider in the night…
from your sister.
Stay.
This was sent from the Eyrie.
What’s she doing at the Eyrie?
She hasn’t been back there since her wedding.
What news?
She’s fled the capital.
She says Jon Arryn was murdered.
By the Lannisters.
She says the king is in danger.
She’s fresh widowed, Cat.
She doesn’t know what she’s saying.
Lysa’s head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter.
Do you think she would risk her life,her son’s life,if she wasn’t certainher husband was murdered?
If this news is true…
and the Lannisters conspire against the throne,who but you can protect the king?
They murdered the last Hand.
Now you want Ned to take the job?
The king rode for a month to ask for Lord Stark’s help.
He’s the only one he trusts.
You swore the king an oath, my lord.
He’s spent half his life fighting Robert’s wars.
He owes him nothing.
Your father and brother rode south once on a king’s demand.
A different time.
A different king.
When do I meet with the khal?
We need to begin planning the invasion.
If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown,you shall have it.
When?
When their omens favour war.
I piss on Dothraki omens.
I’ve waited years to get my throne back.
Etayo akka.
A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair.
Jadi, zhey Jorah andahli!
Khal vezhven.
A small gift, for the new khaleesi.
Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.
Thank you, ser.
Are you from my country?
Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.
I served your father for many years.
Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king.
Dragon’s eggs, Daenerys,from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai.
The ages have turned them to stone,but they will always be beautiful.
Thank you, Magister.
She’s beautiful.
Ser Jorah, I…
I don’t know how to say “thank you”in Dothraki.
There is no word for “thank you”in Dothraki.
Make him happy.
No.
Do you know the common tongue?
No.
Is “no” the only word that you know?
No.
Rough night, Imp?
If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other,it’ll be a miracle.
I didn’t pick you for a hunter.
The greatest in the land my spear never misses.
It’s not hunting if you pay for it.
Are you as good with a spear as you used to be?
No, but I’m still better than you.
I know what I’m putting you through.
Thank you for saying yes.
I only ask you because I need you.
You’re a loyal friend.
You hear me?
A loyal friend.
The last one I’ve got.
I hope I’ll serve you well.
You will.
And I’ll make sure you don’t look so fucking grim all the time.
Come on, boys, let’s go kill some boar!
Come on, you.
Stop!
Stop.
Are you completely mad?
He saw us.
It’s all right, it’s all right.
It’s all right.
He saw us!
I heard you the first time.
Quite the little climber, aren’t you?
How old are you, boy?
Ten.
Ten.
The things I do for love.To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
You need to drink, child.
And eat.
Isn’t there anything else.
The Dothraki have two things in abundance grass and horses.
People can’t live on grass.
In the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai,they say there are fields of ghost grass with stalks as pale as milk that glow in the night.
It murders all other grass.
The Dothraki believe that one day it will cover everything that’s the way the world will end.
It’ll get easier.
Khaleesi.
Your hands.
We’re still not far from Pentos,Your Grace.
Master Illyrio has extended his hospitality.
You’d be more comfortable there.
I have no interest in hospitality or comfort.
I’ll stay with Drogo until he fulfills his end of the bargain and I have my crown.
As you wish, Your Grace.
Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is,I suppose it is preferable to beheading.
What did Ned Stark want you for.
Buying from a slaver.
Selling to one.
Some poachers I caught on my land.
Under my reign, you won’t be punished for such nonsense.
You can rest assured of that.
Better looking bitches than you’re used to, Uncle.
My mother’s been looking for you.
We ride for King’s Landing today.
Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies.
What good will my sympathies do them.
None.
But it is expected of you.
Your absence has already been noted.
The boy means nothing to me.
And I can’t stand the wailing of women.
One word and I’ll hit you again.
I’m telling Mother.
Go.
Tell her.
But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are,that you are at their service,and that all your prayers are with them.
Do you understand.
You can’t.
Do you understand.
The Prince will remember that, little lord.
I hope so.
If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him.
Ah.
Time for breakfast.
Bread.
And two of those little fish.
And a mug of dark beer to wash it down.
And bacon, burnt black.
Hyah.
Little brother.
Beloved siblings.
Is Bran going to die.
Apparently not.
What do you mean.
The maester says the boy may live.
It’s no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain.
Only the gods know for certain.
All the rest of us can do is pray.
The charms of the North seem entirely lost on you.
I still can’t believe you’re going.
It’s ridiculous, even for you.
Where’s your sense of wonder.
The greatest structure ever built,the intrepid men of the Night’s Watch,the wintry abode of the white walkers.
Tell me you’re not thinking of taking the black.
And go celibate.
The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock.
No, I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.
The children don’t need to hear your filth.
Come.
Even if the boy lives,he’ll be a cripple, a grotesque.
Give me a good, clean death any day.
Speaking for the grotesques, I’d have to disagree.
Death is so final, whereas life.
.
.
ah, life is full of possibilities.
I hope the boy does wake.
I’d be very interested to hear what he has to say.
My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you’re on.
My dear brother, you wound me.
You know how much love my family.
Please.
Oh, I would have dressed, Your Grace.
This is your home.
I’m your guest.
Handsome one, isn’t he.
I lost my first boy,a little blackhaired beauty.
He was a fighter too tried to beat the fever that took him.
Forgive me.
It’s the last thing you need to hear right now.
I never knew.
It was years ago.
Robert was crazed,beat his hands bloody on the wall,all the things men do to show you how much they care.
The boy looked just like him.
Such a little thing.
A bird without feathers.
They came to take his body away and Robert held me.
I screamed and I battled, but he held me.
That little bundle.
They took him away and I never saw him again.
Never have visited the crypt, never.
I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you.
I am grateful.
Perhaps this time she’ll listen.
A sword for the Wall.
I already have one.
Good man.
Have you swung it yet.
Of course I have.
At someone, I mean.
It’s a strange thing,the first time you cut a man.
You realise we’re nothing but sacks of meat and blood,and some bone to keep it all standing.
Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall wildlings and white walkers and whatnot.
We’re grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us.
We’ve guarded the Kingdoms for , years.
Is it “we” already.
Have you taken your vows, then.
Soon enough.
Give my regards to the Night’s Watch.
I’m sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force.
And if not.
.
.
it’s only for life.
Thank you, Nymeria.
Septa Mordane says I have to do it again.
My things weren’t properly folded, she says.
Who cares how they’re folded.
They’re going to get all messed up anyway.
It’s good you’ve got help.
Watch.
Nymeria, gloves.
Impressive.
Shut up.
Nymeria, gloves.
I have something for you.
And it has to be packed very carefully.
A present.
Close the door.
This is no toy.
Be careful you don’t cut yourself.
It’s so skinny.
So are you.
I had the blacksmith make it for you special.
It won’t hack a man’s head off,but it can poke him full of holes if you’re quick enough.
I can be quick.
You’ll have to work at it every day.
How does it feel.
Do you like the balance.
I think so.
First lesson stick them with the pointy end.
I know which end to use.
I’m going to miss you.
Careful.
All the best swords have names, you know.
Sansa can keep her sewing needles.
I’ve got a needle of my own.
I came to say goodbye to Bran.
You’ve said it.
I wish I could be here when you wake up.
I’m going north with Uncle Benjen.
I’m taking the black.
I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together,but you’ll be able to come visit meat Castle Black when you’re better.
I’ll know my way around by then.
I’ll be a sworn brother of the Night’s Watch.
We can go out walking beyond the Wall,if you’re not afraid.
I want you.
.
.
to leave.
years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon.
You came back a year later with another woman’s son.
And now you’re leaving again.
I have no choice.
That’s what men always say when honour calls.
That’s what you tell your families,tell yourselves.
You do have a choice.
And you’ve made it.
Cat.
.
.
I can’t do it, Ned.
I really can’t.
You can.
You must.
You’ve said goodbye to Bran.
He’s not going to die.
I know it.
You Starks are hard to kill.
My mother.
She was very kind.
Good.
Next time I see you,you’ll be all in black.
It was always my colour.
Farewell, Snow.
And you, Stark.
There’s great honour serving in the Night’s Watch.
The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years.
And you are a Stark.
You might not have my name,but you have my blood.
Is my mother alive.
Does she know about me.
Where I am, where I’m going.
Does she care.
The next time we see each other,we’ll talk about your mother.
Hmm.
I promise.
Gods, this is country.
I’ve half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going.
I’ve half a mind to go with you.
What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides,a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight.
You should have asked me years ago.
There were wars to fight,women to marry we never had the chance to be young.
I recall a few chances.
There was that one.
.
.
Oh, what was her name.
That common girl of yours.
Becca.
With the great big tits you could bury your face in.
Bessie.
She was one of yours.
Bessie.
Thank the gods for Bessie.
And her tits.
Yours was, er.
.
.
Aleena.
No.
You told me once.
Er.
.
.
Meryl.
Your bastard’s mother.
Wylla.
That’s it.
She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honour.
You never told me what she looked like.
Nor will I.
We were at war.
None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again.
You’re too hard on yourself.
You always have been.
I swear if I weren’t your king,you’d have hit me already.
The worst thing about your coronation I’ll never get to hit you again.
Trust me, that’s not the worst thing.
There was a rider in the night.
Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord.
What of it.
Do we send her a wedding gift.
A knife perhaps, a good, sharp one,and a bold man to wield it.
She’s little more than a child.
Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.
Tell me we’re not speaking of this.
Oh, it’s unspeakable to you.
What her father did to your family that was unspeakable.
What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister the woman I loved.
I’ll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on.
But you can’t get your Hands on this one, can you.
This Khal Drogo,it’s said he has , men in his horde.
Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm,as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea.
They have no ships, Robert.
There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me usurper.
If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him.
He will not cross.
And if by chance he does,we’ll throw him back into the sea.
There’s a war coming, Ned.
I don’t know when,I don’t know who we’ll be fighting,but it’s coming.
Sit.
You’ll be fed.
Untie them.
Ah, rapers.
They were given a choice, no doubt castration or the Wall.
Most choose the knife.
Not impressed by your new brothers.
Lovely thing about the Watch you discard your old family and get a whole new one.
Why do you read so much.
Look at me and tell me what you see.
Is this a trick.
What you see is a dwarf.
If I’d been born a peasant they might’ve left me out in the woods to die.
Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock.
Things are expected of me.
My father was the Hand of the King for years.
Until your brother killed that king.
Yes, until my brother killed him.
Life is full of these little ironies.
My sister married the new king, and.
.
.
my repulsive nephew will be king after him.
I must do my part for the honour of my house.
Wouldn’t you agree.
But how.
Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind,and a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone.
That’s why I read so much, Jon Snow.
And you.
What’s your story, bastard.
Ask me nicely and maybe I’ll tell you, dwarf.
A bastard boy with nothing to inherit,off to join the ancient order of the Night’s Watch,alongside his valiant brothers in arms.
The Night’s Watch protects the realm from.
.
.
Ah, yes, yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about.
You’re a smart boy.
You don’t believe that nonsense.
Everything’s better with some wine in the belly.
It’s time we reviewed the accounts, my lady.
You’ll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us.
Talk to Poole about it.
Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady.
We need a new steward,and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention.
I don’t care about appointments.
I’ll make the appointments.
We’ll talk about it first thing in the morning.
Very good, my lord.
My lady.
When was the last time you left this room.
I have to take care of him.
He’s not going to die, Mother.
Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed.
What if he’s wrong.
Bran needs me.
Rickon needs you.
He’s six.
He doesn’t know what’s happening.
He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying.
.
.
Close the windows.
I can’t stand it.
Please make them stop.
Fire.
You stay here.
I’ll come back.
You’re not supposed to be here.
No one is supposed to be here.
It’s a mercy.
He’s dead already.
No.
Have you ever seen a dragon.
Dragon gone, Khaleesi.
Everywhere.
Even in the East.
No dragon.
Brave men kill them.
It is known.
It is known.
A trader from Qarth told me that dragons come from the moon.
The moon.
He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi,that once there were two moons in the sky.
But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat, and out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun’s fire.
Moon is no egg.
Moon is goddess wife of sun.
It is known.
It is known.
Leave me with her.
Why did the trader from Qarthtell you these stories.
Men like to talk when they’re happy.
Before your brother bought me for you,it was my job to make men happy.
How old were you.
I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.
Nine.
.
I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi.
First you must learn.
Can you teach mehow to make the khal happy.
Yes.
Will it take three years.
No.
Welcome.
What I am about to tell youmust remain between us.
I don’t think Bran fell from that tower.
I think he was thrown.
The boy was alwayssurefooted before.
Someone tried to kill him twice.
Why.
Why murder an innocent child.
Unless he saw somethinghe wasn’t meant to see.
Saw what, my lady.
I don’t know.
But I would stake my lifethe Lannisters are involved.
We already have reason to suspecttheir loyalty to the Crown.
Did you notice the dagger the killer used.
It’s too fine a weapon for such a man.
The blade is Valyrian steel,the handle dragonbone.
Someone gave it to him.
They come into our homeand try to murder my brother.
If it’s war they want.
.
.
If it comes to that,you know I’ll stand behind you.
What, is there going to bea battle in the Godswood.
Hmm.
Too easily words of warbecome acts of war.
We don’t know the truth yet.
Lord Stark must be told of this.
I don’t trust a ravento carry these words.
I’ll ride to King’s Landing.
No.
There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.
I will go myself.
Mother, you can’t.
I must.
I’ll send Hal with a squadof guardsmen to escort you.
Too large a party attracts unwanted attention.
I don’t want the Lannistersto know I’m coming.
Let me accompany you at least.
The Kingsroad can be a dangerous placefor a woman alone.
What about Bran.
I have prayed to the Sevenfor more than a month.
Bran’s life is in their hands now.
No, Khaleesi.
You must look in his eyes always.
Love comes in at the eyes.
It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes.
Finish a man.
Oh.
Kings travelled across the world for a night with Irogenia.
Magisters sold their palaces.
Khals burned her enemiesjust to have her for a few hours.
They say a thousand menproposed to herand she refused them all.
Well, she sounds likean interesting woman.
I.
.
.
I don’t thinkthat Drogo will like it with me on top.
You will make him like it, Khaleesi.
Men want what they’ve never had.
And the Dothraki take slaves likea hound takes a bitch.
Are you a slave, Khaleesi.
Then don’t make love like a slave.
Very good, Khaleesi.
Out there he is the mighty khal,but in this tent, he belongs to you.
I.
I don’t think that this is the Dothraki way.
If he wanted the Dothraki way,why did he marry you.
No.
No.
Tonight I would look upon your face.
Pardon me, ser.
Do I frighten you so much, girl.
Or is it him there making you shake.
He frightens me too.
Look at that face.
I’m sorry if I offended you, ser.
Why won’t he speak to me.
He hasn’t been very talkativethese last years.
Since the Mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.
He speaks damn wellwith his sword though.
Ser Ilyn Payne, the King’s Justice.
The Royal Executioner.
What is it, sweet lady.
Does the hound frighten you.
Away with you, dog.
You’re scaring my lady.
I don’t like to see you upset.
The sun’s finally shining.
Come walk with me.
Stay, Lady.
I probably shouldn’t have any more.
Father only lets ushave one cup at feasts.
My princess can drink as much as she wants.
Don’t worry.
You’re safe with me.
I’ll get you.
Arya.
Ow.
What are you doing here.
Go away.
Your sister.
And who are you, boy.
Mycah, my lord.
He’s the butcher’s boy.
He’s my friend.
A butcher’s boy who wants to be a knight, eh.
Pick up your sword, butcher’s boy.
Let’s see how good you are.
She asked me to, my lord.
She asked me to.
I’m your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword.
It’s not a sword, my prince.
It’s only a stick.
And you’re not a knight.
Only a butcher’s boy.
That was my lady’s sister you were hitting.
Do you know that.
Stop it.
Arya, stay out of this.
I won’t hurt him.
much.
Arya.
Filthy little bitch.
No, no, stop it, stop it, both of you.
You’re spoiling it.
You’re spoiling everything.
I’ll gut you, you little cunt.
Arya.
Nymeria.
Arya.
Nymeria.
No.
No.
Please don’t.
Arya, leave him alone.
My prince, my poor prince,look what they did to you.
Stay here.
I’ll go back to the inn and bring help.
Then go.
Don’t touch me.
The wolf’s not here.
Look down by the stream.
You’ve got to go.
They’ll kill youfor what you did to Joffrey.
Go on.
Run.
Go.
Leave now.
It’s a direwolf.
I’ll check down here.
I think I heard a noise.
Go.
Arya.
Arya.
Arya.
Arya.
Arya.
Arya.
My lord.
My Lord.
They’ve found her.
She’s unharmed.
Arya.
Where is she.
She’s been taken directly before the king.
Who took her.
The Lannisters found her.
Arya.
Right, get back.
The queen ordered themto bring her straight to him.
Back.
Back to the inn.
All back.
I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.
Are you hurt.
No.
Oh, it’s all right.
What is the meaning of this.
Why was my daughter not brought to me at once.
How dare you speak to your king in that manner.
Quiet, woman.
Sorry, Ned.
I never meant to frighten the girl.
But we need to get this business done quickly.
Your girl and that butcher’s boyattacked my son.
That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.
That’s not true.
She just
bit him a little.
He was hurting Mycah.
Joff told us what happened.
You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.
That’s not what happened.
Yes, it is.
They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.
Liar.
Shut up.
Enough.
He tells me one thing,she tells me another.
Seven hells.
What am I to make of this.
Where’s your other daughter, Ned.
In bed, asleep.
She’s not.
Sansa, come here, darling.
Now, child.
tell me what happened.
Tell it all and tell it true.
It’s a great crime to lie to a king.
I don’t know.
I don’t remember.
Everything happened so fast.
I didn’t see.
Liar.
Liar, liar, liar.
Arya.
Hey, stop it.
That’s enough of that.
Liar, liar, liar.
Stop.
Arya.
She’s as wild as that animal of hers.
I want her punished.
What would you have me do,whip her through the streets.
Damn it, children fight.
It’s over.
Joffrey will bear these scarsfor the rest of his life.
You let that little girl disarm you.
Ned, see to it that your daughteris disciplined.
I’ll do the same with my son.
Gladly, Your Grace.
And what of the direwolf.
What of the beastthat savaged your son.
I’d forgot the damned wolf.
We found no trace of the direwolf,Your Grace.
No.
So be it.
We have another wolf.
As you will.
You can’t mean it.
A direwolf’s no pet.
Get her a dog.
She’ll be happier for it.
He doesn’t mean Lady, does he.
No, no, not Lady.
Lady didn’t bite anyone.
She’s good.
Lady wasn’t there.
You leave her alone.
Stop them.
Don’t let them do it.
Please, please, it wasn’t Lady.
Is this your command.
Your Grace.
Where is the beast.
Chained up outside, Your Grace.
Ser Ilyn, do me the honour.
No.
Jory.
.
.
take the girls to their rooms.
If it must be done,then I’ll do it myself.
Is this some trick.
The wolf is of the North.
She deserves better than a butcher.
The butcher’s boy you rode him down.
He ran.

Welcome, Lord Stark.
Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the Small Council.
The honour of your presence is requested.
Get the girls settled in.
I’ll be back in time for supper.
And, Jory, you go with them.
Yes, my lord.
If you’d like to change into something more appropriate…
Thank the gods you’re here, Stark.
About time we had some stern northern leadership.
Glad to see you’re protecting the throne.
Sturdy old thing.
How many kings’ arses have polished it, I wonder?
Um, what’s the line?
The king shits and the Hand wipes.
Very handsome armour.
Not a scratch on it.
I know.
People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss.
You’ve chosen your opponents wisely then.
I have a knack for it.
It must be strange for you, coming into this room.
I was standing right here when it happened.
He was very brave, your brother.
Your father, too.
They didn’t deserve to die like that.
Nobody deserves to die like that.
But you just stood there and watched.
men just stood there and watched.
All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms.
You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger?
No, Lord Stark.
men and this room was silent as a crypt.
Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing.
And later…
when I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned…
It felt like justice.
Is that what you tell yourself at night?
You’re a servant of justice?
That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen’s back?
Tell me, if I’d stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?
You served him well…
when serving was safe.
Lord Stark.
Lord Varys.
I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad.
We are all praying for Prince Joffrey’s full recovery.
A shame you didn’t say a prayer for the butcher’s son.
Renly!
You’re looking well.
And you look tired from the road.
I told them this meeting could wait another day, but…
But we have a kingdom to look after.
I’ve hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark.
No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.
She has, Lord Baelish.
I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.
All too well.
I still carry a token of his esteem…
from navel to collarbone.
Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.
It wasn’t the man that I chose, my lord.
It was Catelyn Tully.
A woman worth fighting for, I’m sure you’ll agree.
I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark.
Grand Maester.
How many years has it been?
You were a young man.
And you served another king.
Oh, how forgetful of me.
This belongs to you now.
Should we begin?
Without the king?
Winter may be coming, but I’m afraid the same cannot be said for my brother.
His Grace has many cares.
He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.
We are the lords of small matters here.
My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honour of Lord Stark’s appointment as Hand of the King.
Mm, how much?
, gold dragons to the champion, to the runnerup, to the winning archer.
Can the treasury bear such expense?
I’ll have to borrow it.
The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect.
We already owe Lord Tywin three million gold.
What’s another ,?
Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?
I’m telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
How could you let this happen?
The master of coin finds the money.
The king and the Hand spend it.
I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.
Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn’t always listen.
“Counting coppers,” he calls it.
I’ll speak to him tomorrow.
This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.
As you will.
But still, we’d best make our plans.
There will be no plans…
until I speak to Robert.
Forgive me, my lords.
I’m…
I had a long ride.
You are the King’s Hand, Lord Stark.
We serve at your pleasure.
Ow!
Please, it’s nearly healed.
It’s ugly.
A king should have scars.
You fought off a direwolf.
You’re a warrior like your father.
I’m not like him.
I didn’t fight off anything.
It bit me and all I did was scream.
And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them.
That’s not true.
You killed the beast.
You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father.
I didn’t, I…
When Aerys Targaryen sat on the iron throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor.
Someday you’ll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it.
Do I have to marry her?
Yes.
She’s very beautiful and young.
If you don’t like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses.
And if you’d rather fuck painted whores, you’ll fuck painted whores.
And if you’d rather lie with noble virgins, so be it.
You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be.
Do something nice for the Stark girl.
I don’t want to.
No, but you will.
The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road.
We allow the northerners too much power.
They consider themselves our equals.
How would you handle them?
I’d double their taxes and command them to supply , men to the royal army.
A royal army?
Why should every lord command his own men?
It’s primitive, no better than the hill tribes.
We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers, instead of a mob of peasants who’ve never held pikes in their lives.
And if the northerners rebel?
I’d crush them.
Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as warden of the North.
Uncle Kevan, maybe.
And these , northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?
For me.
I’m their king.
Mmhm.
But you’ve just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers.
I’m not asking.
The North cannot be held, not by an outsider.
It’s too big and too wild.
And when the winter comes, the seven gods together couldn’t save you and your royal army.
A good king knows when to save his strength…
and when to destroy his enemies.
So you agree…
the Starks are enemies?
Everyone who isn’t us…
is an enemy.
Enough of that, young lady.
Eat your food.
I’m practicing.
Practicing for what?
The prince.
Arya, stop!
He’s a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.
The Hound killed your friend.
The Hound does whatever the prince tells him to do.
You’re an idiot.
You’re a liar, and if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive.
Enough!
What’s happening here?
Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.
Go to your room.
We’ll speak later.
That’s for you, love.
The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella’s toys.
Don’t you like it?
I haven’t played with dolls since I was eight.
May I be excused?
You’ve barely eaten a thing.
It’s all right.
Go on.
War was easier than daughters.
Go away!
Arya, open the door.
May I come in?
Whose sword is that?
Mine.
Give it to me.
I know this maker’s mark.
This is Mikken’s work.
Where did you get this?
This is no toy.
Little ladies shouldn’t play with swords.
I wasn’t playing.
And I don’t want to be a lady.
Come here.
Now what do you want with this?
It’s called Needle.
Oh, a blade with a name.
And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle?
Your sister?
Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?
Stick ’em with the pointy end.
That’s the essence of it.
I was trying to learn.
I asked Mycah to practice with me.
I asked him.
It was my fault.
No, sweet girl.
No, no, you didn’t kill the butcher’s boy.
I hate them.
I hate all of them.
The Hound, the queen and the king and Joffrey and Sansa.
Sansa was dragged before the king and queen…
and asked to call the prince a liar.
So was I!
He is a liar.
Shh, darling, listen to me.
Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday.
She cannot betray him.
She must take his side even when he’s wrong.
But how you can let her marry someone like that?
Well…
Look at me.
You’re a Stark of Winterfell.
You know our words.
Winter is coming.
You were born in the long summer.
You’ve never known anything else.
But now winter is truly coming.
And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another.
Sansa is your sister.
I don’t hate her.
Not really.
I don’t want to frighten you, but I won’t lie to you either.
We’ve come to a dangerous place.
We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves.
All right?
Go on.
It’s yours.
I can keep it?
Try not to stab your sister with it.
If you’re going to own a sword, you’d better know how to use it.
Don’t listen to it.
Crows are all liars.
I know a story about a crow.
I hate your stories.
I know a story about a boy who hated stories.
I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall.
Those were always your favourites.
Those weren’t my favourites.
My favourites were the scary ones.
Oh, my sweet summer child.
What do you know about fear?
Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep.
Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die, all in darkness.
That is the time for fear, my little lord, when the white walkers move through the woods.
Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation.
Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts.
And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks.
So is this the sort of story that you like?
In that darkness, the white walkers came for the first time.
They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds…
What are you telling him now?
Only what the little lord wants to hear.
Get your supper.
I want some time with him.
One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blueeyed giant named Macomber.
Maybe we do.
How do you feel?
You still don’t remember anything?
Bran, I’ve seen you climb a thousand times.
In the wind, in the rain…
A thousand times.
You never fall.
I did though.
It’s true, isn’t it, what Maester Luwin says about my legs?
I’d rather be dead.
Don’t ever say that.
I’d rather be dead.
Fewer eyes back here, my lady.
But still too many.
It’s nine years since I’ve set foot in the capital.
And no one knew who I was the last time I came, either.
My lady.
Welcome to King’s Landing, Lady Stark.
Would you mind following us?
I would.
We’ve done nothing wrong.
We’ve been instructed to escort you into the city.
Instructed?
I don’t know who’s providing your instructions, but…
Follow me, Lady Stark.
Cat!
Go on.
Go upstairs.
You little worm!
You take me for some backalley Sally you can drag into a…
Pssst!
I meant no disrespect, to you of all people.
How dare you bring me here?
Have you lost your mind?
No one will come looking for you here.
Isn’t that what you wanted?
I’m truly sorry…
about the locale.
How did you know I was coming to King’s Landing?
A dear friend told me.
Lady Stark.
Lord Varys.
To see you again after so many years is a blessing.
Your poor hands.
How did you know I was coming?
Knowledge is my trade, my lady.
Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance?
My little birds are everywhere…
even in the North.
They whisper to me the strangest stories.
Valyrian steel.
Do you know whose dagger this is?
I must admit I do not.
Well, well, this is an historic day.
Something you don’t know that I do.
There’s only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms.
It’s mine.
Yours?
At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey’s last nameday.
I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would.
When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger.
To whom?
Tyrion Lannister.
The Imp.
Grenn, show him what you farm boys are made of.
If that were a real sword, you’d be dead.
Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you.
Pyp.
Do you think Ned Stark’s bastard bleeds like the rest of us?
Next!
Next!
Well, Lord Snow, it appears you’re the least useless person here.
Go clean yourselves up!
There’s only so much I can stomach in a day.
A charming man.
I don’t need him to be charming.
I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night’s Watch.
And how’s that going, Commander Mormont?
Slowly.
A raven came…
for Ned Stark’s son.
Good news or bad?
Both.
Lord Stark.
I meant…
to give you this earlier.
So forgetful these days.
A raven from Winterfell this morning.
Good news?
Perhaps you’d like to share it with your wife.
My wife is in Winterfell.
Is she?
Yes, I’m looking at you.
I thought that she’d be safest in here.
One of several such establishments I own.
You’re a funny man.
Huh?
A very funny man.
Ned!
Ah, the Starks…
Quick tempers, slow minds.
You broke my nose, bastard!
It’s an improvement.
If we threw you over the Wall, I wonder how long it would take you to hit.
I wonder if they’d find you before the wolves did.
What are you looking at, halfman?
I’m looking at you.
Yes.
You’ve got an interesting face.
Hmm, very distinctive faces.
All of you.
And what do you care about our faces?
It’s just…
I think they would look marvellous decorating spikes in King’s Landing.
Perhaps I’ll write to my sister, the queen, about it.
We’ll talk later, Lord Snow.
Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me.
No one but you.
My father knew and he left me to rot at the Wall all the same.
Grenn’s father left him too…
outside a farmhouse, when he was three.
Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese.
His little sister hadn’t eaten in three days.
He was given a choice his right hand or the Wall.
I’ve been asking the Lord Commander about them.
Fascinating stories.
They hate me because I’m better than they are.
It’s a lucky thing none of them were trained by a masteratarms like your Ser Rodrik.
I don’t imagine any of them had ever held a real sword before they came here.
Oh…
Your brother Bran.
He’s woken up.
The mere suggestion that the queen’s brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.
We have proof.
We have the blade.
Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him.
The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy’s wolf.
Petyr has promised to help us find the truth.
He’s like a little brother to me, Ned.
He would never betray my trust.
I’ll try to keep you alive, for her sake.
A fool’s task, admittedly, but I’ve never been able to refuse your wife anything.
I won’t forget this.
You’re a true friend.
Don’t tell anyone.
I have a reputation to maintain.
How could you be so stupid?
Calm down.
He’s a child.
Ten years old.
What were you thinking?
I was thinking of us.
You’re a bit late to start complaining about it now.
What has the boy told them?
Nothing.
He remembers nothing.
Then what are you raving about?
What if it comes back to him?
If he tells his father what he saw…
We’ll say he was lying.
We’ll say he was dreaming.
We’ll say whatever we like.
I think we can outfox a tenyearold.
And my husband?
I’ll go to war with him if I have to.
They can write a ballad about us “The War For Cersei’s Cunt.
” Let me go.
Never.
Let me go.
The boy won’t talk.
And if he does, I’ll kill him.
Him, Ned Stark, the king the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world.
I wish I could see the girls.
It’s too dangerous.
Just for a moment.
Until we know who our enemies are.
I know they did it, Ned.
The Lannisters.
In my bones, I know it.
Littlefinger’s right.
I can’t do anything without proof.
And if you find the proof?
Then I bring it to Robert…
and hope he’s still the man I once knew.
You watch yourself on the road, huh?
That temper of yours is a dangerous thing.
My temper?
Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday.
He still loves you.
Does he?
Off with you.
Yes, it’s been a long time.
But I still remember every face.
You remember your first?
Of course, Your Grace.
Who was it?
A Tyroshi.
Never learned the name.
Hmm.
How did you do it?
Lance through the heart.
Quick one.
Lucky for you.
Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall.
My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud.
He came running at me, this dumb highborn lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with a single swing of his sword.
I knocked him down with the hammer.
Gods, I was strong then.
Caved in his breastplate.
Probably shattered every rib he had.
Stood over him, hammer in the air.
Right before I brought it down he shouted, “Wait!
Wait.
” They never tell you how they all shit themselves.
They don’t put that part in the songs.
Stupid boy.
Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else.
He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys, and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he’d be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl.
Wine!
Lancel.
Gods, what a stupid name.
Lancel Lannister.
Who named you?
Some halfwit with a stutter?
What are you doing?
It’s empty, Your Grace.
What do you mean, it’s empty?
There’s no more wine.
Is that what empty means?
!
So get more.
Tell your cousin to get in here.
Kingslayer!
Get in here.
Surrounded by Lannisters.
Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces.
It must wound your pride, huh?
Standing out there like a glorified sentry.
Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin…
forced to mind the door while your king eats and drinks and shits and fucks.
So come on.
We’re telling war stories.
Who was your first kill, not counting old men?
One of the outlaws in the brotherhood.
I was there that day.
You were only a squire, years old.
You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte.
Best move I ever saw.
A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina.
Your outlaw…
any last words?
I cut his head off, so no.
Hmm.
What about Aerys Targaryen?
What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back?
I never asked.
Did he call you a traitor?
Did he plead for a reprieve?
He said the same thing he’d been saying for hours…
“Burn them all.
” If that’s all, Your Grace…
Do the Dothraki buy their slaves?
The Dothraki don’t believe in money.
Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.
From whom?
If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices pay tribute or fight.
An easy choice for most.
Of course, sometimes it’s not enough.
Sometimes a khal feels insulted by the number of slaves he’s given.
He might think the men too weak or the women too ugly.
Sometimes a khal decides his riders haven’t had a good fight in months and need the practice.
Tell them all to stop.
You want the entire horde to stop?
For how long?
Until I command them otherwise.
You’re learning to talk like a queen.
Not a queen.
A khaleesi.
You dare!
You give commands to me?
To me?
You do not command the dragon.
I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.
I don’t take orders from savages or their sluts.
Do you hear me?
Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi.
No.
Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect.
Please.
Please, don’t hurt him.
Tell him I don’t want my brother harmed.
Huh?
Mormont!
Kill these Dothraki dogs!
I am your king!
Shall we return to the khalasar, Khaleesi?
Uh uh uh uh uh.
You…
walk.
I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time.
I’m leaving this morning.
You’re leaving?
I’m the First Ranger.
My job is out there.
There have been disturbing reports.
What kind of reports?
The kind I don’t want to believe.
I’m ready.
I won’t let you down.
You’re not going.
You’re no ranger, Jon.
But I’m better than every…
Better than no one!
Here…
a man gets what he earns, when he earns it.
We’ll speak when I return.
A bear’s balls.
Oh, you’re joking?
And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart, all fried in his own fat.
When you’re a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves.
And how do a bear’s balls taste?
A bit chewy.
And what about you, my lord?
What’s the strangest thing you’ve eaten?
Do Dornish girls count?
So…
you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bring them here as eager recruits?
Aye.
But it’s not all of ’em’s done bad things.
Some of ’em’s just poor lads looking for steady feed.
Some of ’em’s highborn lads looking for glory.
They have a better chance finding feed than glory.
The Night’s Watch is a joke to you, is it?
Is that what we are, Lannister?
An army of jesters in black?
You don’t have enough men to be an army and, aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny.
I hope we’ve provided you with some good stories to tell when you’re back in King’s Landing.
It’s something to think about while you’re drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels.
Half the boys you’ve seen training will die north of the Wall.
Might be a wildling’s axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold.
They die in pain.
And they do it…
so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort.
Do you think I’m plump?
Listen, Benjen…
May I call you Benjen?
Call me what you like.
I’m not sure what I’ve done to offend you.
I have great admiration for the Night’s Watch.
I’ve great admiration for you as First Ranger.
You know, my brother once told me…
that nothing someone says before the word “but” really counts.
But…
I don’t believe that giants and ghouls and white walkers are lurking beyond the Wall.
I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when that wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it.
You’re right.
The wildlings are no different from us.
A little rougher maybe.
But they’re made of meat and bone.
I know how to track them and I know how to kill them.
It’s not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights.
You’ve never been north of the Wall, so don’t tell me what’s out there.
Are you going below?
Keep well, keep warm.
Enjoy the capital, brother.
Oh, I always do.
I think he’s starting to like me.
“Going below”?
Aye.
Into the tunnel and out the other side.
He’ll be north of the Wall for a month or two.
So…
you’re heading down to King’s Landing too.
Aye, day after tomorrow.
I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons.
Let’s share the road.
I could use some decent company.
I, er…
I travel a bit on the grubby side, my lord.
Not this time.
We’ll be staying at the finest castles and inns.
No one turns away a Lannister.
Yes, Khaleesi.
Oh, what are you doing?
When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi?
You change, Khaleesi.
It’s a blessing from the Great Stallion For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle.
It’s a good weapon for a Dothrakan.
But a man in full plate…
…
the arakh won’t get through the steel.
That’s where the broadsword has the advantage.
Designed for piercing plate.
Dothraki don’t wear steel dresses.
Armour.
Armour.
Armour make a man, erm…
Slow.
Slow.
It’s true, but it also keeps a man alive.
My father taught me how to fight.
He taught me that speed defeats size.
I’ve heard that your father was a famous warrior.
He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo.
And your father, Jorah the Andal?
He was a warrior also?
He still is.
A man of great honour and I betrayed him.
The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight.
Kill some rabbits.
There are no rabbits.
Find some ducks, she likes ducks.
Have you seen any ducks, woman?
No rabbits, no ducks.
Do you have eyes in your head?
Do you?
Dog then.
I have seen many dogs.
I don’t think she wants to eat dog.
The khaleesi have baby inside her.
It is true.
She does not bleed for two moons.
Her belly start to swell.
A blessing from the Great Stallion.
She does not want to eat horse.
I’ll have the boys butcher a goat for supper.
I need to ride to Qohor.
Uh, we ride for Vaes Dothrak.
Don’t worry.
I’ll catch you.
The horde’s easy to find.
Don’t stand so still.
It’s harder to hit a moving target.
Except for you.
You move too much.
I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.
How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?
Eight.
No, nine.
All of them brief?
They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon.
This summer has lasted nine.
But reports from the citadel tell us the days grow shorter.
The Starks are always right eventually winter is coming.
This one will be long…
and dark things will come with it.
We’ve been capturing wildlings, more every month.
They’re fleeing south.
The ones who flee…
say they’ve seen the white walkers.
Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids.
One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions.
He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off.
The Night’s Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond.
And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men.
There are less than a thousand of us now.
We can’t man the other castles on the Wall.
We can’t properly patrol the wilderness.
We’ve barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed.
Your sister sits by the side of the king.
Tell her…
we need help.
When winter does come, gods help us all if we’re not ready.
It’s a boy.
How do you know?
I know.
I’m sorry to see you leave, Lannister.
It’s either me or this cold, and it doesn’t appear to be going anywhere.
Will you stop at Winterfell on your way south?
I expect I will.
Gods know there aren’t many feather beds between here and King’s Landing.
If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him.
Tell him I’d visit if I could.
Of course.
He’ll never walk again.
If you’re going to be a cripple, it’s better to be a rich cripple.
You take care, Snow.
Farewell, my lord.
You are late, boy.
Tomorrow you will be here at midday.
Who are you?
Your dancing master, Syrio Forel.
Tomorrow you will catch it.
Now pick it up.
That is not the way, boy.
It is not a greatsword that is needing two hands to swing it.
It’s too heavy.
It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong.
Just so.
One hand is all that is needed.
Now you are standing all wrong.
Turn your body sideface.
Yes.
So.
You are skinny.
That is good.
The target is smaller.
Now the grip let me see.
Yes.
The grip must be delicate.
What if I drop it?
The steel must be part of your arm.
Can you drop part of your arm?
No.
Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos.
He knows these things.
You must listen to me, boy.
I’m a girl.
Boy, girl…
You are a sword, that is all.
That is the grip.
You are not holding a battleaxe.
You are holding…
A needle.
Ahhh.
Just so.
Now we will begin the dance.
Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning…
The knight’s dance, hacking and hammering.
This is the Braavos dance…
the water dance.
It is swift…
and sudden.
All men are made of water.
Do you know this?
If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die.
Now you will try to strike me.
Ha!
Up!
Ha!
Ah.
Dead.
Oh!
Dead.
Hup!
Very dead.
Come.
Ah ah ah!
Hup!
Again, faster.
Ah.To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
The little lord’s been dreaming again.
We have visitors.
I don’t want to see anyone.
Really?
If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I’d go mad.
Anyway, you don’t have a choice.
Robb’s waiting.
I don’t want to go.
Neither do I.
But Robb’s Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says, and you do what I say.
Hodor!
Hodor?
Help Bran down the hall.
Hodor.
I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.
Any man of the Night’s Watch is welcome at Winterfell.
Any man of the Night’s Watch, but not I, eh, boy?
I’m not your boy, Lannister.
I’m Lord of Winterfell while my father is away.
Then you might learn a lord’s courtesy.
So it’s true.
Hello, Bran.
Do you remember anything about what happened?
He has no memory of that day.
Curious.
Why are you here?
Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel?
My neck is beginning to hurt.
Kneel, Hodor.
Do you like to ride, Bran?
Yes.
Well, I mean I did like to.
The boy has lost the use of his legs.
What of it?
With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride.
I’m not a cripple.
Then I’m not a dwarf.
My father will rejoice to hear it.
I have a gift for you.
Give that to your saddler.
He’ll provide the rest.
You must shape the horse to the rider.
Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy’s voice.
Will I really be able to ride?
You will.
On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.
Is this some kind of trick?
Why do you want to help him?
I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things.
You’ve done my brother a kindness.
The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.
Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark.
There’s a brothel outside your walls.
There I’ll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier.
Couldn’t resist some northern arse?
If you like Redheads, ask for Ros.
Come to see me off, Greyjoy?
Kind of you.
Your master doesn’t seem to like Lannisters.
He’s not my master.
No, of course not.
What happened here?
Where is Lady Stark?
Why didn’t she receive me?
She wasn’t feeling well.
She’s not in Winterfell, is she?
Where did she go?
M’lady’s whereabouts…
M’lady?
Your loyalty to your captors is touching.
Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey?
I still remember seeing my father’s fleet burn in Lannisport.
I believe your uncles were responsible.
Must have been a pretty sight.
Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive.
Yes, a great victory for your people.
Shame how it all turned out.
We were outnumbered ten to one.
A stupid rebellion, then.
I suppose your father realised that when your brothers died in battle.
Now here you are, your enemy’s squire.
Careful, Imp.
I’ve offended you.
Forgive me, it’s been a rough morning.
Anyway, don’t despair.
I’m a constant disappointment to my own father and I’ve learned to live with it.
Your next tumble with Ros is on me.
I’ll try not to wear her out.
Shoulder, legs.
Leg, shoulder, leg.
Left foot forward.
Good.
Now pivot as you deliver the stroke.
Put all your weight behind it.
What in seven hells is that?
They’ll need an eighth hell to fit him in.
Tell them your name.
Samwell Tarly, of Horn Hill…
I mean, I was of Horn Hill.
I’ve come to take the black.
Come to take the black pudding.
Well, you couldn’t be any worse than you look.
Rast…
see what he can do.
I yield.
Please, no more.
On your feet.
Pick up your sword.
Hit him till he finds his feet.
It seems they’ve run short of poachers and thieves down south.
Now they send us squealing bloody pigs.
Jon!
Again, harder.
I yield!
Enough!
He yielded.
Looks like the bastard’s in love.
All right then, Lord Snow, you wish to defend your lady love, let’s make it an exercise.
You two.
Three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal.
All you’ve got to do is get past the bastard.
Are you sure you want to do this?
No.
Yield, yield, yield!
I yield.
We’re done for today.
Go clean the armoury.
That’s all you’re good for.
Well fought!
Piss off.
Did he hurt you?
I’ve had worse.
You can call me Sam…
if you want.
My mother calls me Sam.
It’s not going to get any easier, you know?
You’re going to have to defend yourself.
Why didn’t you get up and fight?
I wanted to.
I just couldn’t.
Why not?
I’m a coward.
My father always says so.
The Wall’s no place for cowards.
You’re right.
I’m sorry.
I just…
wanted to thank you.
A bloody coward.
People saw us talking to him.
Now they’ll think we’re cowards too.
You’re too stupid to be a coward.
You’re too stupid to be a…
Quick now, before summer’s over.
Come here!
Hyah, hyah!
Vaes Dothrak the city of the horselords.
A pile of mud.
Mud and shit and twigs.
Best these savages can do.
These are my people now.
You shouldn’t call them savages.
I’ll call them what I like, because they’re my people.
This is my army.
Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army.
If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?
The Dothraki have never crossed the narrow sea.
They fear any water their horses can’t drink.
But if they did?
King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different.
And you know these men?
I fought beside them once, long ago.
Now Ned Stark wants my head.
He drove me from my land.
You sold slaves.
Aye.
Why?
I had no money and an expensive wife.
And where is she now?
In another place, with another man.
Your Grace?
Yes, my dear?
They call you the last dragon…
They do.
You have dragon’s blood in your veins?
It’s entirely possible.
What happened to the dragons?
I was told that brave men killed them all.
The brave men didn’t kill dragons.
The brave men rode them.
Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen.
The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne, which the Usurper is keeping warm for me.
The swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them…
melted together like so many candles.
I have always wanted to see a dragon.
There’s nothing in the world that I would rather see.
Really.
Why dragons?
They can fly.
And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and they’re somewhere else…
far away.
And they can kill.
Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing…
…
melted…
like so many candles.
Ow.
Yes.
Seeing a dragon would make me very happy.
Well, after years in a pleasure house, I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy.
I was not locked in.
I have seen things.
What have you seen?
I’ve seen…
a man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass.
Ooh.
I’ve seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes.
And I’ve seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of coloured silk.
So…
have you seen one?
A pirate ship?
A dragon.
No.
No, the last one died many years before I was born.
I’ll tell you what I have seen their skulls.
They used to decorate the throne room in the Red Keep.
When I was very young, just three or four, my father used to walk me down the rows and I’d recite their names for him.
When I got them all right, he’d give me a sweet.
The ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch and they were all stunted and wrong with skulls no bigger than dog skulls.
But…
But as you got closer to the Iron Throne…
they got bigger and bigger and bigger.
There was Ghiscar and Valryon, Vermithrax, Essovius…
…
Archonei, Meraxes, Vhagar…
and Balerion the Dread…
…
whose fire forged the Seven Kingdoms into one.
What happened to the skulls?
I don’t know.
The Usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect.
Scattered to the wind.
That’s very sad.
Yes, it is.
What did I buy you for?
To make me sad?
No, Your Grace.
To, uh, teach your sister.
To teach my sister how to be a better lover?
You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy?
Oh, you pretty little idiot.
Go on, then.
Get on with it.
Someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side.
And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court.
All the lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince.
What if I have a girl?
Gods be good, you’ll have boys and girls and plenty of them.
What if I only have girls?
I wouldn’t worry about that.
Jeyne Poole’s mother had five children all of them girls.
Yes, but it’s highly unlikely.
But what if?
Well, if you only had girls, I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffrey’s little brother.
And everyone would hate me.
Nobody could ever hate you.
Joffrey does.
Nonsense.
Why would you say such a thing?
That business with the wolves?
Sansa…
I’ve told you a hundred times a direwolf is not…
Please shut up about it.
Do you remember your lessons?
Who built the Iron Throne?
Aegon the Conqueror.
And who built the Red Keep?
Maegor the Cruel.
And how many years did it take to build…
My grandfather and uncle were murdered here, weren’t they?
They were killed on the orders of King Aerys, yes.
The Mad King.
Commonly known as the Mad King.
Why were they killed?
You should speak to your father about these matters.
I don’t want to speak to my father, ever.
Sansa, you will find it in your heart to forgive your father.
No, I won’t.
It’s the Hand’s Tournament that’s causing all this trouble, my lords.
The King’s Tournament.
I assure you the Hand wants no part of it.
Call it what you will, Lord Stark, ser, the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day.
Last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters.
Dreadful.
If you can’t keep the king’s peace, perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can.
I need more men.
You’ll get .
Lord Baelish will see it paid for.
I will?
You found money for a champion’s purse, you can find money to keep the peace.
I’ll also give you of my household guard till the crowds have left.
Thank you, my lord Hand, ser.
They will be put to good use.
The sooner this is over, the better.
The realm prospers from such events, my lord.
They give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes.
And every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bowlegged.
I’m sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket.
Hmm.
Now…
if there’s nothing else, my lords?
Oh, this heat.
On days like this, I envy you northerners, your summer snows.
Until tomorrow, my lord.
I’ve been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn.
Lord Arryn?
Oh, his death was a great sadness to all of us.
I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him.
His sickness struck him very hard and very fast.
I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed.
Lord Jon often came to me for counsel.
Why?
I have been grand maester for many years.
Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since…
What did Jon want the night before he died?
Oh, he came inquiring after a book.
A book?
What book?
Oh, I fear it would be of little interest to you, my lord.
A…
A ponderous tome.
No, I’d like to read it.
The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children.
Harkon Umber, first of his name, born to Lord Hother Umber and Lady Amaryllis Umber in the rd year after Aegon’s landing, at the Last Hearth.
Blue of eye, brown of hair and fair complected, died in his th year of a wound sustained in a bear hunt.
As I said, my lord, a ponderous read.
Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it?
He did not, my lord.
And I did not presume to ask.
Jon’s death…
Such a tragedy.
…
did he say anything to you during his final hours?
Nothing of import, my lord.
Oh.
There was one phrase he kept repeating.
“The seed is strong,” I think it was.
“The seed is strong”?
Mmm.
What does that mean?
Oh, the dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark.
For all the weight they’re given, last words are usually as significant as first words.
And you’re quite certain he died of a natural illness?
What else could it be?
Poison.
A disturbing thought.
No, no, no, I don’t think it likely.
The Hand was loved by all.
What sort of man would dare…
I’ve heard it said that poison is a woman’s weapon.
Yes, women, cravens…
and eunuchs.
Did you know that Lord Varys is a eunuch?
Everybody knows that.
Yes, yes, of course.
How that sort of person found himself on the king’s council, I will never know.
I’ve taken enough of your time.
No trouble at all, my lord.
It’s a great honour.
Thank you.
I’ll find my own way out.
Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.
It’s a hard fall down these steps.
Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better.
Tomorrow I’m going to be chasing cats.
Cats?
Syrio says.
He says every swordsman should study cats.
They’re as quiet as shadows and as light as feathers.
You have to be quick to catch them.
He’s right about that.
Now that Bran’s awake, will he come live with us?
Well, he needs to get his strength back first.
He wants to be a knight of the Kingsguard.
He can’t be one now, can he?
No.
But someday he could be lord of a holdfast or sit on the king’s council.
Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder.
Can I be lord of a holdfast?
You will marry a high lord and rule his castle.
And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords.
Hmm?
No.
That’s not me.
Hello.
Ser Alliser said I’m to be your new watch partner.
I should warn you, I don’t see all that well.
Come stand by the fire.
It’s warmer.
No, that’s all right.
I’m fine.
You’re not.
You’re freezing.
I don’t like high places.
You can’t fight.
You can’t see.
You’re afraid of heights and almost everything else probably.
What are you doing here, Sam?
On the morning of my th nameday, my father came to me.
“You’re almost a man now,” he said.
“But you’re not worthy of my land and title.
“Tomorrow, you’re going to take the black, “forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north.
“If you do not,” he said, “then we’ll have a hunt “and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble “and you’ll be thrown from your saddle to die.
“Or so I’ll tell your mother.
“Nothing would please me more.
” Ser Alliser’s going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn’t he?
Yes, he is.
I’m not going to get any better, you know.
Well…
you can’t get any worse.
I hear you’re reading a boring book.
Hmph.
Pycelle talks too much.
Oh, he never stops.
Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale?
Not surprising.
Until recently, he was only a squire Jon Arryn’s squire.
He was knighted almost immediately after his master’s untimely death.
Knighted for what?
Why are you telling me this?
I promised Cat that I’d help you.
Where is Ser Hugh?
I’ll speak to him.
A singularly bad idea.
Do you see that boy there?
One of Varys’s little birds.
The spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings.
Now look there.
That one belongs to the queen.
And do you see that septa pretending to read her book?
Varys or the queen?
No, she’s one of mine.
Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?
Yes.
The wiser answer was no, my lord.
Get a message to this paragon of yours discreetly.
Send him to question Ser Hugh.
After that, you might want him to visit a certain armourer in the city.
He lives in a large house at the top of the Street of Steel.
Why?
I have my observers, as I said, and it’s possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armourer several times in the weeks before his death.
Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you.
Distrusting me was the wisest thing you’ve done since you climbed off your horse.
…
Ser Hugh? …
Ser Hugh!
As you can see, I’m busy.
I’m here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the King.
I’m the captain of his guard.
I’m sorry.
I didn’t catch your name, Ser…
No “ser”.
I’m not a knight.
I see.
Well, it just so happens that I am.
He said he’d be glad to talk to the Hand himself.
He’s a knight, you see.
Ah, a knight.
They strut around like roosters down here.
Even the ones who’ve never seen an arrow coming their way.
You shouldn’t be out here, my lord.
There’s no telling who has eyes where.
Let them look.
The former Hand did call on me, my lord, several times.
I regret to say he did not honour me with his patronage.
What did Lord Arryn want?
He always came to see the boy.
I’d like to see him as well.
As you wish, my lord.
Gendry!
Here he is.
Strong for his age.
He works hard.
Show the Hand the helmet you made, lad.
This is fine work.
It’s not for sale.
Boy, this is the King’s Hand!
If his lordship wants the helmet…
I made it for me.
Forgive him, my lord.
There’s nothing to forgive.
When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?
He just asked me questions is all, my lord.
What kind of questions?
About my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here.
But then he started asking me about my mother.
Your mother?
Who she was, what she looked like.
What did you tell him?
She died when I was little.
She had yellow hair.
She’d sing to me sometimes.
Look at me.
Get back to work, lad.
If the day ever comes when that boy would rather wield a sword than forge one, you send him to me.
Find anything?
King Robert’s bastard son.
He likes that.
This is for the king from Lord Stark.
Should I leave it with…
Shhh.
Listen.
Do you hear them?
How many do you think are in there with him?
Huh?
Guess.
Three.
Four.
He likes to do this when I’m on duty.
He makes me listen as he insults my sister.
Forgive me, my lord…
Why do I have to forgive you?
Have you wronged me?
We’ve met before, you know.
Have we?
Strange, I’ve forgotten.
The siege of Pyke.
We fought side by side one afternoon.
Ah.
That’s where you got your scar?
Aye.
Oh.
One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.
Vicious sons of whores.
They like their bloodshed.
They stopped liking it at the end.
That was a proper battle.
Do you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?
With his burning sword?
I’ll remember that till the day I die.
I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell.
It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.
Theon?
He’s a good lad.
I doubt it.
I’ll bet you smell of blackberry jam!
Let me smell it.
Come here.
Can I leave this with you?
The message from Lord Stark.
I don’t serve Lord Stark.
Where have you been?
Watch duty.
With Sam.
Ah, Prince Porkchop.
Where is he?
He wasn’t hungry.
Impossible!
That’s enough.
Sam’s no different from the rest of us.
There was no place for him in the world, so he’s come here.
We’re not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore.
Never again, no matter what Thorne says.
He’s our brother now and we’re going to protect him.
You are in love, Lord Snow.
You girls can do as you please.
But if Thorne puts me up against Lady Piggy, I’m gonna slice me off a side of bacon.
No one touches Sam.
What are you waiting for?
Attack him!
You get in there.
Hit me.
Go on, hit me!
I yield!
Yield.
Yield.
I yield.
You think this is funny, do you?
When you’re out there beyond the Wall with the sun going down, do you want a man at your back?
Or a snivelling boy?
You send this whore to give me commands?
I should have sent you back her head!
Forgive me, Khaleesi.
I did as you asked.
Hush now.
It’s all right.
Irri, take her and leave us.
Yes, Khaleesi.
Why did you hit her?
How many times do I have to tell you?
You do not command me.
I wasn’t commanding you.
I just wanted to invite you to supper.
What’s this?
It’s a gift.
I had it made for you.
Dothraki rags?
Are you going to dress me now?
Please.
This stinks of manure.
All of it.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop it.
You would turn me into one of them, wouldn’t you?
Next you’ll want to braid my hair.
You’ve no right to a braid.
You’ve won no victories yet.
You do not talk back to me!
You are a horselord’s slut.
And now you’ve woken the dragon…
I am a khaleesi of the Dothraki!
I am the wife of the great khal and I carry his son inside me.
The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands.
I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Mole’s Town.
I wouldn’t doubt it.
Don’t you think it’s a little bit unfair?
Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little Sally on the side?
Sally on the side?
It’s silly, isn’t it?
What, we can’t defend the Wall unless we’re celibate?
It’s absurd.
I didn’t think you’d be so upset about it.
Why not?
Because I’m fat?
No.
But I like girls just as much as you do.
They might not like me as much.
I’ve never…
been with one.
You’ve probably had hundreds.
No.
As a matter of fact, I’m the same as you.
Yeah.
Yeah, I…
I find that hard to believe.
I came very close once.
I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but…
Didn’t know where to put it?
I know where to put it.
Was she…
old and ugly?
Young and gorgeous.
A whore named Ros.
What colour hair?
Red.
Oh, I like red hair.
And her, um…
Her…
You don’t want to know.
What, that good?
Better.
Oh, no.
So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect?
What’s my name?
Jon Snow.
And why is my surname Snow?
Because…
you’re a bastard from the North.
I never met my mother.
My father wouldn’t even tell me her name.
I don’t know if she’s living or dead.
I don’t know if she’s a noblewoman or a fisherman’s wife…
or a whore.
So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes.
But I couldn’t do it.
Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow?
It’s not a good life for a child.
Ah, mmm.
So…
you didn’t know where to put it?
Enjoying yourselves?
You look cold, boys.
It is a bit nippy.
A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors.
It’s still summer.
Do you boys even remember the last winter?
How long has it been now?
What, years?
I remember.
Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell?
Were there days when you just couldn’t get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?
I build my own fires.
That’s admirable.
I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall during the last winter.
It was supposed to be a twoweek mission.
We heard a rumour Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch.
So we went out to look for some of his men capture them, gather some knowledge.
The wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men.
Harder than you’ll ever be.
They know their country better than we do.
They knew there was a storm coming in.
So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass.
And we got caught in the open.
Wind so strong it yanked foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all.
If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost.
And all in darkness.
You don’t know cold.
Neither of you do.
The horses died first.
We didn’t have enough to feed them, to keep them warm.
Eating the horses was easy.
But later when we started to fall…
That wasn’t easy.
We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn’t we?
Soft, fat boys like you.
We’d have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones left over for soup.
Soon we’ll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the lord commander for assignment, and they will call you men of the Night’s Watch, but you’d be fools to believe it.
You’re boys still.
And come the winter you will die…
like flies.
I hit him.
I hit the dragon.
Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon.
Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.
He is still the true king.
The truth now.
Do you want to see your brother sitting on the Iron Throne?
No.
But the common people are waiting for him.
Illyrio said they are sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.
The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends.
They don’t care what games the high lords play.
What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?
Home.
I pray for home too.
My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms.
He couldn’t lead an army even if my husband gave him one.
He’ll never take us home.
Lovers’ quarrel?
I’m sorry.
Do I?
Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish.
He’s known…
An old friend of the family.
I’ve known your mother a long, long time.
Why do they call you Littlefinger?
Arya!
Don’t be rude!
No, it’s quite all right.
When I was a child, I was very small, and I come from a little spit of land called the Fingers, so you see, it’s an exceedingly clever nickname.
I’ve been sitting here for days!
Start the damn joust before I piss myself!
Gods, who’s that?
Ser Gregor Clegane.
They call him the Mountain.
The Hound’s older brother.
And his opponent?
Ser Hugh of the Vale.
He was Jon Arryn’s squire.
Look how far he’s come.
Yes, yes, enough of the bloody pomp.
Have at him!
Not what you were expecting?
Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound?
Lovely little tale of brotherly love.
The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe.
Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation.
Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence.
One evening Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire Gregor’s toy, a wooden knight.
Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals.
Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted.
There aren’t very many people who know that story.
I won’t tell anyone.
I promise.
No, please don’t.
If the Hound so much as heard you mention it, I’m afraid all the knights in King’s Landing would not be able to save you.
My lord, Her Grace the queen.
Your Grace.
You’re missing your tournament.
Putting my name on it doesn’t make it mine.
I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us the ugliness with the wolves.
And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme.
Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned.
How is Sansa?
She likes it here.
She’s the only Stark who does.
Favours her mother, not much of the North in her.
What are you doing here?
I might ask the same of you.
What is it you hope to accomplish?
The king called on me to serve him and the realm, and that’s what I’ll do until he tells me otherwise.
You can’t change him.
You can’t help him.
He’ll do what he wants, which is all he’s ever done.
You’ll try your best to pick up the pieces.
If that’s my job, then so be it.
You’re just a soldier, aren’t you?
You take your orders and you carry on.
I suppose it makes sense.
Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow.
I was also trained to kill my enemies, Your Grace.
As was I.
Seven blessings to you, goodfolk!
And to you.
Boy!
Bread, meat and beer.
Quickly.
Ah, good idea, Grandfather.
I’m starving.
A song while we wait or?
I’d rather throw myself down a well.
Now, now, Grandfather, this may be your last chance if you’re heading North.
The only music the northerners know is the howling of wolves!
Gods.
I’m sorry, my lord.
We’re full up.
Every room.
My men can sleep in the stable.
As for myself, I don’t require a large room.
Truly, my lord, we have nothing.
Is there nothing I can do…
…
to remedy this?
You can have my room.
Now there’s a clever man.
You can manage food, I trust?
Yoren, dine with me.
Aye, my lord.
My lord of Lannister!
Might I entertain you while you eat?
I can sing of your father’s victory at King’s Landing!
Nothing would more likely ruin my supper.
Lady Stark!
What an unexpected pleasure.
I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell.
Lady Stark!
I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I stayed here.
You, ser.
Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat?
It is, my lady.
And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father, Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?
She is.
The red stallion was always a welcome sight at Riverrun.
My father counts Jonos Bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen.
Our lord is honoured by his trust.
I envy your father all his fine friends, Lady Stark, but I don’t quite see the purpose of this.
I know your sigil as well the twin towers of Frey.
How fares your lord, ser?
Lord Walder is well, my lady.
He has asked your father for the honour of his presence on his th nameday.
He plans to take another wife.
Ha!
This man…
came into my house as a guest and there conspired to murder my son.
A boy of .
In the name of King Robert and the good lords you serve, I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the king’s justice.To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
Does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital?
No.
I stood vigil for him myself last night.
He had no one else.
He’d never worn this armour before.
Bad luck for him going against the Mountain.
Who determines the draw?
All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark.
Aye.
But who holds the straws?
You’ve done good work, Sisters.
Life is strange.
Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the Trident.
I’m glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan.
As is my wife.
I don’t think the widow’s life would suit her.
You’re too modest.
I’ve seen you cut down a dozen great knights.
My father once told me you were the best he’d ever seen.
I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat.
He was a fine man, your father.
What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime.
And that lad he was a squire until a few months ago.
How could he afford a new suit of armour?
Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money?
I hear the king wants to joust today.
Yes, that will never happen.
Robert tends to do what he wants.
If the king got what he wanted all the time, he’d still be fighting a damned rebellion.
It’s made too small, Your Grace.
It won’t go.
Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse.
Did you know that?
Look at this idiot!
One ball and no brains.
He can’t even put a man’s armour on him properly.
You’re too fat for your armour.
Fat?
Fat, is it?
Is that how you speak to your king?
Oh, it’s funny, is it?
No, Your Grace.
No?
You don’t like the Hand’s joke?
You’re torturing the poor boy.
You heard the Hand.
The king’s too fat for his armour.
Go find the breastplate stretcher now!
“The breastplate stretcher”?
How long before he figures it out?
Maybe you should have one invented.
All right, all right.
You watch me out there.
I still know how to point a lance.
You’ve no business jousting.
Leave that for the young men.
Why, because I’m king?
Piss on that.
I want to hit somebody!
And who’s going to hit you back?
Anybody who can.
And the last man in his saddle…
Will be you.
There’s not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you.
Are you telling me those cowards would let me win?
Aye.
Drink.
I’m not thirsty.
Drink.
Your king commands it.
Gods, too fat for my armour.
Your squire a Lannister boy?
Mm.
A bloody idiot, but Cersei insisted.
I have Jon Arryn to thank for her.
“Cersei Lannister will make a good match,” he told me.
“You’ll need her father on your side.
” I thought being king meant I could do whatever I wanted.
Enough of this.
Let’s go watch ’em ride.
At least I can smell someone else’s blood.
Robert.
What?
Oh.
An inspiring sight for the people, eh?
Come, bow before your king!
Bow, you shits!
Where’s Arya?
At her dancing lessons.
The Knight of the Flowers.
Thank you, Ser Loras.
Don’t let Ser Gregor hurt him.
Hey.
I can’t watch.
A hundred gold dragons on the Mountain.
I’ll take that bet.
Now what will I buy with gold dragons?
A dozen barrels of Dornish wine?
Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?
Or you could even buy a friend.
He’s going to die.
Ser Loras rides well.
Such a shame, Littlefinger.
It would have been so nice for you to have a friend.
And tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend?
Loras knew his mare was in heat.
Quite crafty, really.
Ser Loras would never do that.
There’s no honour in tricks.
No honour and quite a bit of gold.
Sword!
Leave him be!
Stop this madness in the name of your king!
Let him go!
I owe you my life, ser.
I’m no ser.
Remove his hood.
# On that eve, the captive Imp # Downwards from his horse did limp # No more would he preen and primp # In garb of red and gold # This isn’t the Kingsroad.
You said we were riding for Winterfell.
I did…
Often and loudly.
Very wise.
They’ll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place.
Word’s probably gotten to my father by now.
He’ll be offering a handsome reward.
Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts.
Would you be so good as to untie me?
And why would I do that?
Why not?
Am I going to run?
The hill tribes would kill me for my boots.
Unless a shadowcat ate me first.
Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns.
Ah, the eastern road.
We’re going to the Vale.
You’re taking me to your sister’s to answer for my imagined crimes.
Tell me, Lady Stark, when was the last time you saw your sister?
Five years ago.
She’s changed.
She was always a bit touched, but now…
You might as well kill me here.
I am not a murderer, Lannister.
Neither am I.
I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son’s life.
The dagger found…
What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?
Should I gag him?
Why?
Am I starting to make sense?
Rodrik!
My lady, this way.
Untie me.
If I die, what’s the point?
Ah!
Rodrik?
I’ll be fine, my lady.
There’s no need to bloody yourself.
Your first?
You need a woman.
Nothing like a woman after a fight.
I’m willing if she is.
Bran.
The Iron Islands.
Sigil a kraken.
Words “We do not sow.
” Lords?
The Greyjoys.
Famed for their skills at archery, navigation and lovemaking.
And failed rebellions.
Sigil a stag, a crowned stag now that Robert’s king.
Good.
Words “Ours is the fury.
” Lords the Baratheons.
Mmhm.
The Westerlands.
Sigil a lion.
Mmm.
Words “A Lannister always pays his debts.
” No.
A common saying, but not their official motto.
Lords the Lannisters.
We’re still on their words.
I don’t know them.
You do know them.
Think.
“Unbowed, unbent, unbroken.
” That’s House Martell.
“Righteous in wrath.
” House Hornwood.
“Family, duty, honour.
” Those are Tully words your mother’s.
Are we playing a game?
Family, duty, honour…
Is that the right order?
You know it is.
Family comes first?
Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family.
How can she protect the family if she’s not with her family?
Your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept.
And then she left!
When you were born, I was the one who pulled you from your mother.
I placed you in her arms.
From that moment until the moment she dies, she will love you.
Absolutely.
Fiercely.
Why did she leave?
I still can’t tell you, but she will be home soon.
Do you know where she is now?
Today?
No, I don’t.
Then how can you promise me she’ll be home soon?
Sometimes I worry you’re too smart for your own good.
I’ll never shoot another arrow.
And where is that written?
You need legs to work a bow.
Hmm.
If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works, you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback.
Really?
Dothraki boys learn when they’re four years old.
Why shouldn’t you?
Shh, keep it down.
You’re not supposed to be inside the castle walls.
I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here.
Important enough for the likes of you.
You’re not the only nobleman in my life, you know.
Who, the Imp?
I’d call him half a nobleman.
Jealous?
Why should I be jealous?
Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night.
What’s a dwarf like down below?
I’ve always wondered.
Might surprise you.
Hmm?
He’s good with his fingers too.
And his tongue.
Generous tipper.
I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.
You are jealous.
I’m a Greyjoy.
We’ve been lords of the Iron Islands for years.
There’s not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters.
And what about the Starks?
I’ve been Lord Stark’s ward since I was eight years old.
A ward that’s a nice word for it.
Your father rebelled against King Robert and if he does it again…
My father fought for the freedom of his people.
What did your father do?
Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.
You’re a very serious boy.
I’m not a boy.
Oh, yes, you are.
A serious boy with a serious cock.
I don’t want to pay for it.
Then get yourself a wife.
Come on.
I’m not gonna hurt you.
How is your son, my lord?
He’ll never walk again.
But his mind is sound?
So they say.
A blessing, then.
I suffered an early mutilation myself.
Some doors close forever…
others open in most unexpected places.
May I?
If the wrong ears heard what I’m about to tell you, off comes my head.
And who would mourn poor Varys then?
North or South, they sing no songs for spiders.
But there are things you must know.
You are the King’s Hand and the king is a fool your friend, I know, but a fool and doomed unless you save him.
I’ve been in the capital a month.
Why have you waited so long to tell me this?
I didn’t trust you.
So why do you trust me now?
The queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely.
There are few men of honour in the capital.
You are one of them.
I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem.
What sort of doom does the king face?
The same sort as Jon Arryn.
The tears of lys, they call it.
A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water.
It leaves no trace.
Who gave it to him?
Some dear friend, no doubt.
But which one?
There were many.
Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man.
There was one boy.
All he was he owed to Jon Arryn.
The squire, Ser Hugh?
Pity, what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely.
If Ser Hugh poisoned him…
who paid Ser Hugh?
Someone who could afford it.
Jon was a man of peace.
He was Hand for years good years.
Why kill him?
He started asking questions.
He’s found one bastard already.
He has the book.
The rest will come.
And when he knows the truth, what will he do?
The gods alone know.
The fools tried to kill his son.
What’s worse they botched it.
The wolf and the lion will be at each other’s throats.
We will be at war soon, my friend.
What good is war now?
We’re not ready.
If one Hand can die, why not a second?
This Hand is not the other.
We need time.
Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born.
You know what these savages are.
“Delay,” you say.
“Move fast,” I reply.
This is no longer a game for two players.
It never was.
The first to arrive and the last to leave.
I admire your industry.
You do move quietly.
We all have our qualities.
You look a bit lonely today.
You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening.
First boy is on the house.
I think you’re mistaking business with pleasure.
Am I?
All those birds that whisper in your ear such pretty little things.
Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations.
Oh, I’m sure.
Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear.
I’m a purveyor of beauty and discretion both equally important.
Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no?
Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?
All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.
And I heard the most awful rumour about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers.
Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination.
The logistics alone…
to find beautiful corpses before they rot.
Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the king’s laws.
Strictly speaking.
Tell me.
Does someone somewhere keep your balls in a little box?
I’ve often wondered.
Do you know, I have no idea where they are.
And we had been so close.
But enough about me.
How have you been since we last saw each other?
Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?
Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King.
Saw me with your own eyes?
Eyes I own.
Council business.
We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.
Everyone’s well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark’s wife.
If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy’s life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion…
to think a simple word to the queen…
One shudders at the thought.
Ooh.
But you know something?
I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me.
Have you?
Yes.
Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers.
Was that you under the bed?
And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary…
Council business?
Of course, you would have friends from across the Narrow Sea.
You’re from there yourself, after all.
We’re friends, aren’t we, Lord Varys?
I’d like to think we are.
So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the king might question my friend’s sympathies.
To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right loyalty to the realm…
Oh, please.
To find myself in a position where a simple word to the king…
What are you two conspiring about?
Well, whatever it is, you’d best hurry up.
My brother is coming.
To a small council meeting?
Disturbing news from far away.
Hadn’t you heard?
Off with you.
No begging.
I’m not a beggar.
I live here.
D’you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?
I want to see my father.
I want to fuck the queen, for all the good it does me.
You want your father, boy?
He’s lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends.
My father is Hand of the King!
I’m not a boy.
I’m Arya Stark of Winterfell.
And if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes.
Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?
You know I had half my guard out searching for you?
You promised me this would stop.
They said they were going to kill you.
Who did?
I didn’t see them, but I think one was fat.
Oh, Arya.
I’m not lying!
They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage…
Something about the savage.
Where did you hear this?
In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls.
What were you doing in the dungeons?
Chasing a cat.
Pardon, my lord.
There’s a night’s watchman here begging a word.
Says it’s urgent.
Your name, friend?
Yoren, if it please.
This must be your son.
He has the look.
I’m a girl!
Did Benjen send you?
No one sent me, my lord.
I’m here to find men for the Wall, see if there’s any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service.
Oh, we’ll find recruits for you.
Thank you, my lord.
But that’s not why I disturb you now.
Your brother Benjen, his blood runs black makes him as much my brother as yours.
It’s for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near killed my horse.
There are others riding too.
The whole city will know by tomorrow.
Know what?
Best said in private, my lord.
Go on.
We’ll talk more later.
Jory, take her safely to her room.
Come along, my lady.
You heard your father.
How many guards does my father have?
Here in King’s Landing?
Fifty.
You wouldn’t let anyone kill him, would you?
No fear on that count, little lady.
Well?
It’s about your wife, my lord.
She’s taken the Imp.
You’re far from home, Lady Stark.
To whom do I speak?
Ser Vardis Egan, knight of the Vale.
Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?
There was no time to send word.
May I ask, my lady, why he is with you?
That’s why there was no time.
He is my prisoner.
He doesn’t look like a prisoner.
My sister will decide what he looks like.
Yes, my lady.
She will at that.
The Eyrie.
They say it’s impregnable.
Give me ten good men and some climbing spikes, I’ll impregnate the bitch.
I like you.
Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber.
A meeting has been called.
I need to see the king first alone.
The king is at the small council meeting, my lord.
He has summoned you.
Is it about my wife?
No, my lord.
I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen.
The whore is pregnant.
You’re speaking of murdering a child.
I warned you this would happen, back in the North.
I warned you, but you didn’t care to hear.
Well, hear it now.
I want ’em dead, mother and child both.
And that fool Viserys as well.
Is that plain enough for you?
I want them both dead.
You will dishonour yourself forever if you do this.
Honour?
!
I’ve got seven kingdoms to rule!
One king, seven kingdoms.
Do you think honour keeps them in line?
Do you think it’s honour that’s keeping the peace?
It’s fear fear and blood.
Then we’re no better than the Mad King.
Careful, Ned.
Careful now.
You want to assassinate a girl because the spider heard a rumour?
No rumour, my lord.
The princess is with child.
Based on whose information?
Ser Jorah Mormont.
He is serving as advisor to the Targaryens.
Mormont?
You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?
Jorah Mormont’s a slaver, not a traitor.
Small difference, I know, to an honourable man.
He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land.
We commit murder on the word of this man?
And if he’s right?
If she has a son?
A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army what then?
The Narrow Sea still lies between us.
I’ll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.
Do nothing?
That’s your wise advice?
Do nothing till our enemies are on our shores?
You’re my council.
Counsel!
Speak sense to this honourable fool.
I understand your misgivings, my lord.
Truly, I do.
It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing.
Yet we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm.
Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed.
I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die?
How many towns will burn?
Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?
We should have had them both killed years ago.
When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with.
Cut her throat.
Be done with it.
I followed you into war twice, without doubts, without second thoughts.
But I will not follow you now.
The Robert I grew up with didn’t tremble at the shadow of an unborn child.
She dies.
I will have no part in it.
You’re the King’s Hand, Lord Stark.
You’ll do as I command or I’ll find me a Hand who will.
And good luck to him.
I thought you were a better man.
Out.
Out, damn you.
I’m done with you.
Go, run back to Winterfell!
I’ll have your head on a spike!
I’ll put it there myself, you fool!
You think you’re too good for this?
Too proud and honourable?
This is a war!
I’ll go ahead with my daughters.
Get them ready.
Do it yourself.
Don’t ask anyone for help.
Right away, my lord.
Lord Baelish is here for you.
His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave.
The word “treason” was mentioned.
What can I do for you?
When do you return to Winterfell?
Why?
What do you care?
If you’re still here come nightfall, I’ll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill.
If that sort of thing still interests you.
I don’t have the time.
It won’t take more than an hour.
But as you please.
Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls’ chambers.
Who are your best two swords?
Heward and Wyl.
Find them and meet me at the stables.
You bring him here without permission?
You pollute my home with his presence?
Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing.
You remember her, don’t you?
Isn’t he beautiful?
And strong too.
Jon knew it.
His last words were “The seed is strong.
” He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be.
Look at him, the lord of all the Vale.
Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, warning me…
To stay away from them!
Not to bring one here!
Mummy…
is that the bad man?
It is.
He’s little.
He’s Tyrion the Imp, of House Lannister.
He killed your father.
He murdered the Hand of the King!
Oh, did I kill him too?
I’ve been a very busy man.
You will watch your tongue!
These men are knights of the Vale.
Every one of them loved Jon Arryn.
Every one of them would die for me.
If any harm comes to me, my brother Jaime will see that they do.
You can’t hurt us.
No one can hurt us here.
Tell him, Mummy!
Tell him!
Shhshhshhshhshh, my sweet boy.
He’s just trying to frighten us.
Lannisters are all liars.
No one will hurt my baby.
Mummy…
I want to see the bad man fly.
Perhaps you will, my little love.
This man is my prisoner.
I will not have him harmed.
Ser Vardis, my sister’s guest is weary.
Take him down below so he can rest.
Introduce him to Mord.
You go sleep, dwarf man.
Sleep good, little dwarf man!
Lord Stark’s lucky he still has a head.
Robert will rant for a few days, but he won’t do anything.
He adores the man.
You’re jealous.
Are you sure this won’t hurt?
Only if I slip.
And you’d prefer me like this?
Mmhm.
If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy.
I want you.
My brother thinks that anyone who hasn’t been to war isn’t a man.
He treats me as if I’m a spoilt child.
Oh, and you’re not?
Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers?
How many wars have you fought in?
Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armour of yours?
Hold still.
All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I’m not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood.
You did vomit when that boy’s eye was knocked out in the melee.
His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!
He shouldn’t have entered the melee if he didn’t know how to fight.
Easy for you to say.
Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.
It’s not a gift.
No one gave it to me.
I’m good because I work at it every day of my life since I could hold a stick.
I could work at fighting all day, every day, I’d still never be as good as you.
Yes, well, I guess we’ll never know.
Everywhere?
Everywhere.
So how did it end up?
The Targaryen girl will die?
It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is.
Robert’s rather tasteless about it.
Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches.
It’s a shame he can’t muster the same enthusiasm for his wife.
He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money.
You have to give it to the Lannisters they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money.
I have an outrageous amount of money.
Not as much as the Lannisters.
But a lot more than you.
Robert’s threatening to take me hunting with him.
Last time we were out there for two weeks.
Tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day, all so he can stick his spear into something’s flesh.
Oh.
But Robert loves his killing.
And he’s the king.
Hmm.
How did that ever happen?
Because he loves his killing.
And he used to be good at it.
Do you know who should be king?
Be serious.
I am.
My father could be your bank.
I’ve never fought in a war before, but I’d fight for you.
I’m fourth in line.
And where’s Robert in the line of royal succession?
Joffrey is a monster.
Tommen is eight.
Stannis?
Stannis has the personality of a lobster.
He’s still my older brother.
What are you doing?
!
Look at it.
You cut me.
It’s just blood.
We’ve all got it in us.
Sometimes a little spills.
If you become king, you’re going to see a lot of this.
You need to get used to it.
Go on.
Look.
People love you.
They love to serve you because you’re kind to them.
They want to be near you.
You’re willing to do what needs to be done, but you don’t gloat over it.
You don’t love killing.
Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst?
That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared?
You would be a wonderful king.
I’m sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn’t work out.
You seemed so good together.
I’m glad I could do something to make you happy.
Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces.
I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime.
No.
He’s not serious enough.
I’ll say this for Ned Stark he’s serious enough.
Hmm.
Was it really worth it?
Losing him this way?
I don’t know.
But I do know this if the Targaryen girl convinces her horselord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses the Narrow Sea…
we won’t be able to stop them.
The Dothraki don’t sail.
Every child knows that.
They don’t have discipline.
They don’t have armour.
They don’t have siege weapons.
It’s a neat little trick you do you move your lips and your father’s voice comes out.
Is my father wrong?
Let’s say Viserys Targaryen lands with , Dothraki screamers at his back.
We hole up in our castles.
A wise move only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field.
They leave us in our castles.
They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can’t hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children.
How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee king, their cowardly king hiding behind high walls?
When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all?
We still outnumber them.
Which is the bigger number five or one?
Five.
Five…
One.
One army a real army united behind one leader with one purpose.
Our purpose died with the Mad King.
Now we’ve got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse.
And everybody wants something different.
Your father wants to own the world.
Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow.
What do you want?
We haven’t had a real fight in nine years.
Backstabbing doesn’t prepare you for a fight.
And that’s all the realm is now backstabbing and scheming and arselicking and moneygrubbing.
Sometimes I don’t know what holds it together.
Our marriage.
Ah, so here we sit, years later, holding it all together.
Don’t you get tired?
Every day.
How long can hate hold a thing together?
Well, years is quite a long time.
Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.
What was she like?
You’ve never asked about her, not once.
Why not?
At first, just saying her name even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her.
I thought if I didn’t talk about her, she’d just fade away for you.
When I realised that wasn’t going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite.
I didn’t want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask.
And eventually it became clear that my spite didn’t mean anything to you.
As far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it.
So why now?
What harm could Lyanna Stark’s ghost do to either of us that we haven’t done to each other a hundred times over?
You want to know the horrible truth?
I can’t even remember what she looked like.
I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted.
Someone took her away from me, and seven kingdoms couldn’t fill the hole she left behind.
I felt something for you once, you know?
I know.
Even after we lost our first boy.
For quite a while, actually.
Was it ever possible for us?
Was there ever a time, ever a moment?
No.
Does that make you feel better or worse?
It doesn’t make me feel anything.
She looks like him, don’t she, my lord?
She has his nose, his black hair.
Aye.
Tell him when you see him, my lord.
If it please you, tell him how beautiful she is.
I will.
And tell him I’ve been with no one else.
I swear it, my lord, by the old gods and new.
I don’t want no jewels or nothing, just him.
The king was always good to me.
When Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want?
He wasn’t that sort of man, my lord.
He just wanted to know if the child was happy, healthy.
Looks healthy enough to me.
The girl shall want for nothing.
Brothels make a much better investment than ships, I’ve found.
Whores rarely sink.
What do you know of King Robert’s bastards?
Well, he has more than you, for a start.
How many?
Does it matter?
If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents.
And Jon Arryn tracked them all down.
Why?
He was the King’s Hand.
Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after.
He was overcome with fatherly love.
Come.
Jory!
My lord.
Such a small pack of wolves.
Stay back, ser.
This is the Hand of the King.
Was the Hand of the King.
Now I’m not sure what he is lord of somewhere very far away.
What’s the meaning of this, Lannister?
Get back inside where it’s safe.
I’m looking for my brother.
You remember my brother, don’t you, Lord Stark?
Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man.
I remember him well.
It seems he had some trouble on the road.
You wouldn’t know what happened to him, would you?
He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes.
My lords!
I’ll bring the City Watch.
Come, Stark.
I’d rather you die sword in hand.
If you threaten my lord again…
Threaten?
As in, “I’m going to open your lord “from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of”?
You kill me, your brother’s a dead man.
You’re right.
Take him alive.
Kill his men.
Yah!
My brother, Lord Stark we want him back.To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
Your pardon, Your Grace.
I would rise, but…
Do you know what your wife has done?
She did nothing I did not command.
Who’d have thought she had it in her?
By what right dare you lay hands on my blood?
I am the King’s Hand…
You were the King’s Hand!
You shall now be held accountable.
Oh, will both of you shut your mouths?
Catelyn will release Tyrion and you’ll make your peace with Jaime.
He butchered my men.
Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime.
Quiet, woman.
Jaime has fled the city.
Give me leave to bring him back to justice.
I took you for a king.
Hold your tongue.
He’s attacked one of my brothers and abducted the other.
I should wear the armour and you the gown.
I shall wear this like a badge of honour.
Wear it in silence or I’ll honour you again.
See what she does to me?
My loving wife.
I should not have hit her.
That was not…
That was not kingly.
If we don’t act…
there will be a war.
So tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp to King’s Landing.
She’s had her fun, now put an end to it.
You hear me?
Send a raven and put an end to it.
And what about Jaime Lannister?
What about Jaime?
I’m half a kingdom in debt to his bloody father.
I don’t know what happened between you and those yellowhaired shits.
I don’t want to know.
This is what matters I can’t rule the Kingdoms if the Starks and the Lannisters are at each other’s throats, so enough.
As you command, Your Grace.
With your leave…
I will return to Winterfell and set matters straight.
Piss on that.
Send a raven.
I want you to stay.
I’m the king.
I get what I want.
I never loved my brothers.
A sad thing for a man to admit, but it’s true.
You were the brother I chose.
We’ll talk when I return from the hunt.
The hunt?
Killing things clears my head.
You’ll have to sit on the throne while I’m away.
You’ll hate it more than I do.
The Targaryen girl…
Seven hells!
Don’t start with her again!
The girl will die and I’ll hear no more of it.
Put on the badge.
And if you ever take it off again, I swear to the mother I’ll pin the damned thing on Jaime Lannister.
Khaleesi?
Oh, Khaleesi!
You’re hurt.
Not too fast.
Come on, Dancer.
When are you gonna tell him?
Not now.
Blood for blood.
Come on!
You need to make the Lannisters pay for Jory and the others.
You’re talking about war.
I’m talking about justice.
Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in the bannermen and raise an army.
A Lannister put his spear through your father’s leg.
The Kingslayer rides for Casterly Rock where no one can touch him…
You want me to march on Casterly Rock?
You’re not a boy anymore.
Come on.
They attacked your father.
They’ve already started the war.
It’s your duty to represent your House when your father can’t.
And it’s not your duty, because it’s not your House.
Where’s Bran?
I don’t know.
It’s not my House.
Robb?
All alone in the deep, dark woods.
I’m not alone.
My brother is with me.
I don’t see him.
Got him hidden under your cloak?
Ooh, that’s a pretty pin.
Silver.
We’ll take the pin and the horse.
Get down.
Be quick about it.
I can’t.
The saddle…
The straps.
What’s wrong with you?
You some kind of cripple?
I’m Brandon Stark of Winterfell.
If you don’t let me be, I’ll have you all killed!
Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth.
The boy’s worth nothing dead.
Benjen Stark’s own blood?
Think what Mance would give us.
Piss on Mance Rayder and piss on the North.
We’re going as far south as south goes.
There ain’t no white walkers down in Dorne.
Drop the knife!
Let him go and I’ll let you live.
Robb.
Robb.
Shut up.
Drop the blade!
No, don’t.
Do it.
Are you all right?
Yes.
It doesn’t hurt.
Tough little lad.
In the Iron Islands, you’re not a man until you’ve killed your first enemy.
Well done.
Have you lost your mind?
What if you’d missed?
He would have killed you and cut Bran’s throat.
You don’t have the right…
To save your brother’s life?
It was the only thing to do, so I did it.
What about her?
Give me my life, my lord, and I’m yours.
We’ll keep her alive.
Mord!
Turnkey!
Mord!
Mord!
Dwarf man making noise!
How would you like to be rich?
Dwarf man still making noise.
My family is rich.
We have gold, lots of gold.
I’m prepared to give you lots of gold in…
No gold!
Well, I don’t have it here.
No gold!
Fuck off.
I don’t want to practice today.
No?
They killed Jory.
My father is hurt.
I don’t care about stupid wooden swords.
You are troubled.
Yes.
Good!
Trouble is the perfect time for training.
When you are dancing in the meadow with your dolls and kittens, this is not when fighting happens.
I don’t like dolls and k…
You’re not here.
You’re with your trouble.
If you are with your trouble when fighting happens…
…
more trouble for you.
Just so.
How can you be quick as a snake…
…
or as quiet as a shadow…
…
when you are somewhere else?
You are fearing for your father, hmm?
That is right.
Do you pray to the gods?
The old and the new.
There is only one god…
and his name is death.
And there is only one thing we say to death “Not today.
” She has to eat the whole heart?
I hope that wasn’t my horse.
She’s doing well.
She’ll never keep it down.
Tell me what she’s saying.
“The prince is riding.
“I have heard the thunder of his hooves.
“Swift as the wind he rides.
“His enemies will cower before him…
“…
and their wives will weep tears of blood.
” She’s going to have a boy.
He won’t be a real Targaryen.
He won’t be a true dragon.
“The stallion who mounts the world.
” The stallion is the khal of khals.
He shall unite the people into a single khalasar.
All the people of the world will be his herd.
A prince rides inside me!
And he shall be called Rhaego!
Rhaego!
Rhaego!
Rhaego!
Rhaego!
Rhaego!
Rhaego…
They love her.
Rhaego!
Rhaego!
Rhaego!
Rhaego…
She truly is a queen today.
Don’t let them see you carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak.
You know the law.
It’s not my law.
They don’t belong to you.
Whatever is hers is also mine.
Once, perhaps.
If I sell one egg, I’ll have enough to buy a ship.
Two eggs a ship and an army.
And you have all three.
I need a large army.
I’m the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont.
The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen on my shoulders since I was five years old, and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent.
Never.
Not a piece of it.
How can I carry what I need to carry without it?
Hmm?
Who can rule without wealth or fear or love?
Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honour.
You don’t think I see you looking at my little sister, hmm?
Don’t think I know what you want?
I don’t care.
You can have her.
She can be queen of the savages and dine on the finest bloody horseparts, and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like.
But let me go.
You can go.
You can’t have the eggs.
You swore an oath to me.
Does loyalty mean nothing to you?
It means everything to me.
And yet here you stand.
And yet here I stand.
Mord!
Mord!
Mord!
Mord!
Mord!
Noise again!
About the gold…
No gold!
No gold.
Listen to me!
Listen to me.
Sometimes possession…
is an abstract concept…
When they captured me, they took my purse, but the gold is still mine.
Where?
Where?
I don’t know where, but when they free me…
You want free?
Go be free.
Have you ever heard the phrase…
“Rich as a Lannister”?
Of course you have!
You’re a smart man.
You know who the Lannisters are.
I am a Lannister.
Tyrion, son of Tywin!
And of course, you have also heard the phrase, “a Lannister always pays his debts.
” If you deliver a message from me…
to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt.
I will owe you gold.
If you deliver the message…
and I live, which I very much intend to do.
What message?
Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.
You wish to confess your crimes?
Yes, my lady.
I do, my lady.
The sky cells always break them.
Speak, Imp.
Meet your gods as an honest man.
Where do I begin, my lords and ladies?
I’m a vile man, I confess it.
My crimes and sins are beyond counting.
I have lied and cheated…
gambled and whored.
I’m not particularly good at violence, but…
I’m good at convincing others to do violence for me.
You want specifics, I suppose.
When I was seven, I saw a servant girl…
bathing in the river.
I stole her robe.
She was forced to return to the castle naked and in tears.
If I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing.
When I was , I stuffed my uncle’s boots with goatshit.
When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire.
Poor boy was flogged and…
I escaped justice.
When I was I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew.
I flogged the oneeyed snake.
I skinned my sausage.
I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate.
At least I hope she did.
I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel…
Silence!
What happened next?
What do you think you’re doing?
Confessing my crimes.
Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder my sister’s husband Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King.
Oh, I’m very sorry.
I don’t know anything about all that.
You’ve had your little joke.
I trust you enjoyed it.
Mord, take him back to the dungeon.
But this time find a smaller cell…
with a steeper floor.
Is this how justice is done in the Vale?
You accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me into a cell to freeze and starve?
Where is the king’s justice?
I am accused and demand a trial!
If you’re tried and found guilty, then by the king’s own laws you will pay with your life.
I understand the law.
We have no executioner in the Eyrie.
Life is more elegant here.
Open the Moon Door.
You want a trial, my Lord Lannister.
Very well.
My son will listen to whatever you have to say, and you will hear his judgment.
Then you will leave…
by one door or the other.
No need to bother Lord Robin.
I demand a trial by combat.
You have that right.
My lady, I beg the honour.
Let me be your champion.
The honour should be mine.
For the love I bore your lord husband…
let me avenge his death.
I’ll fight for you, my lady.
It’ll be my honour.
The honour should be mine.
Make the bad man fly!
Ser Vardis…
you’re quiet.
Don’t you want to avenge my husband?
With all my heart, my lady.
But the Imp is half my size.
It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice.
Agreed.
You demanded a trial by combat.
Now I demand a champion.
I have that right, same as you.
My lady, I will gladly fight the Imp’s champion for you.
I wouldn’t be too glad, ser.
I name my brother, Jaime Lannister.
The Kingslayer is hundreds of miles from here.
Send a raven for him.
I’m happy to wait.
The trial will be today.
Do I have a volunteer?
Anyone?
Anyone?
I think we can assume that no one is willing…
I’ll stand for the dwarf.
More wine, Your Grace?
What was I saying?
Simpler time.
It was!
It was.
You’re too young to remember.
Wasn’t it simpler, Selmy?
It was, Your Grace.
The enemy was right there in the open, vicious as you like, all but sending you a bloody invitation.
Nothing like today.
It sounds exhilarating.
Exhilarating, yes.
Not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw.
You ever fuck a Riverlands girl?
Once.
I think.
You think?
I think you’d remember.
Back in our day, you weren’t a real man until you’d fucked one girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms and the Riverlands.
We used to call it “making the eight.
” Those were some lucky girls.
You ever make the eight, Barristan?
I don’t believe so, Your Grace.
Those were the days.
Which days, exactly?
The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died?
Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it?
Or way before that, when dragons burned whole cities to the ground?
Easy, boy.
You might be my brother, but you’re speaking to the king.
I suppose it was all rather heroic.
If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your prick inside and make the eight.
More wine, Your Grace?
They burned most everything in the Riverlands our fields, our granaries, our homes.
They took our women, then they took ’em again.
When they was done, they butchered them as if they was animals.
They covered our children in pitch…
and lit them on fire.
Brigands, most likely.
They weren’t thieves.
They didn’t steal nothing.
They even left something behind, Your Grace.
It’s the King’s Hand you’re addressing, not the king.
The king is hunting.
Fish.
The sigil of House Tully.
Isn’t that your wife’s House Tully my Lord Hand?
These men, were they flying a sigil?
A banner?
None, your…
Hand.
The one who was leading them…
Taller by a foot than any man I’ve ever met, saw him cut the blacksmith in two, saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword.
That sounds like someone we know.
The Mountain.
You’re describing Ser Gregor Clegane.
Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand?
The man is an anointed knight.
I’ve heard him called Tywin Lannister’s mad dog.
I’m sure you have as well.
Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife?
If the Lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the king’s protection, it would be…
That would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.
Well…
I cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life, but perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our king, Robert.
Lord Beric Dondarrion.
You shall have the command.
Assemble men and ride to Ser Gregor’s keep.
As you command.
In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, I charge you to bring the king’s justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes.
I denounce him and attaint him.
I strip him of all ranks and titles…
of all lands and holdings…
and sentence him to death.
My lord…
This…
This is a drastic action.
It would be better to wait for King Robert’s return.
Grand Maester Pycelle.
My lord.
Send a raven to Casterly Rock.
Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen.
He will arrive within the fortnight, or be branded an enemy of the Crown and a traitor to the realm.
A bold move, my lord, and admirable.
But is it wise to yank the lion’s tail?
Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms.
Gold wins wars, not soldiers.
Then how come Robert is king and not Tywin Lannister?
Fight!
Hold!
Attack!
Attack!
Come on, Ser Vardis!
Attack!
Stand and fight, coward!
Yes!
Enough, Ser Vardis!
Finish him.
What are you doing?
Get up!
Get up, get up, get up!
Raise your sword.
Raise it!
Get up, man!
On your feet!
Get up!
Get up and fight, Ser Vardis!
No!
Have mercy!
Is it over?
You don’t fight with honour!
No.
He did.
Can I make the little man fly now?
Not this little man.
This little man is going home.
I believe you have something of mine.
A Lannister always pays his debts.
You wear your hair like a real southern lady now.
Well, why shouldn’t I?
We’re in the South.
It’s important to remember where you come from.
I’m not sure your mother would like these new styles.
My mother isn’t from the North.
I’m aware of that.
Why do you care?
Do you even have hair under there?
Yes.
I have hair.
I’ve never seen it.
Would you like to?
No.
Where are you from anyway?
The North or the South?
I come from a very small village in…
Oh, wait.
I just realized…
I don’t care.
Sansa…
Septa.
Now you are being rude.
My prince.
My prince.
My lady.
I fear I have behaved monstrously the past few weeks.
With your permission?
It’s beautiful, like the one your mother wears.
You’ll be queen someday.
It’s only fitting you should look the part.
Will you forgive me for my rudeness?
There’s nothing to forgive.
You’re my lady.
One day we’ll be married in the throne room.
Lords and ladies from all over the Seven Kingdoms will come, from the last hearth in the North to the salt shore in the South.
And you will be queen over all of them.
I’ll never disrespect you again.
I’ll never be cruel to you again.
Do you understand me?
You’re my lady now…
from this day…
until my last day.
Stop.
Stop!
Whoa.
What are you doing?
Going to King’s Landing.
In a turnip cart?
I’ll find a ship heading south in White Harbor.
And you can afford that?
Some of my friends are more generous than others.
There’s a thousand girls like you in King’s Landing.
So I’ll have lots of company.
Yes, you’ll be very popular…
until some fat lord comes to visit with a big belly and a little prick and he can’t get it up so he knocks all your teeth out.
And what will happen to me if I stay here?
Will I become Lady Greyjoy, Mistress of the Iron Islands?
Don’t be a fool.
I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark in the streets of King’s Landing.
Every man for a hundred miles will be marching off to war soon and most of them will never come back.
There’s nothing left for me here.
Let’s go, Steffon.
Giddy up.
Let me see it one more time!
See what?
I’m going to miss you!
I know.
I’m sending you both back to Winterfell.
What?
Listen…
What about Joffrey?
Are you dying because of your leg?
Is that why you’re sending us home?
What?
No.
Please, Father.
Please don’t.
You can’t.
I’ve got my lessons with Syrio.
I’m finally getting good.
This isn’t a punishment.
I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety.
Can we take Syrio back with us?
Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher?
I can’t go.
I’m supposed to marry Prince Joffrey.
I love him and I’m meant to be his queen and have his babies.
Seven hells.
When you’re old enough, I’ll make you a match with someone who’s worthy of you, someone who’s brave and gentle and strong…
I don’t want someone brave and gentle and strong.
I want him!
He’ll be the greatest king that ever was, a golden lion, and I’ll give him sons with beautiful blond hair.
The lion’s not his sigil, idiot.
He’s a stag, like his father.
He is not.
He’s nothing like that old drunk king.
Go on, girls.
Get your septa and start packing your things.
Wait!
Come on.
But it’s not fair!
“Lord Orys Baratheon, black of hair.
” “Axel Baratheon, black of hair.
” “Lyonel Baratheon, black of hair.
” “Steffon Baratheon, black of hair.
” “Robert Baratheon, black of hair.
” “Joffrey Baratheon…
“goldenhaired.
” Daenerys!
Where’s my sister?
Stop him.
Where is she?
Hmm?
Where is she?
I’m here for the feast.
The whore’s feast?
Come.
Get your hands off me!
No one touches the dragon!
Khal Drogo!
I’m here for the feast.
Khal Drogo says there is a place for you.
Back there.
That is no place for a king.
You are no king.
Keep away from me!
Viserys, please.
There she is.
Put the sword down.
They’ll kill us all.
They can’t kill us.
They can’t shed blood in their sacred city.
But I can.
I want what I came for.
I want the crown he promised me.
He bought you.
But he never paid for you.
Tell him I want what was bargained for or I’m taking you back.
He can keep the baby.
I’ll cut it out and leave it for him.
What’s he saying?
He says yes.
You shall have a golden crown…
…
that men shall tremble to behold.
That was all I wanted.
WWhat was promised.
No!
No!
You cannot touch me.
I am the dragon.
I am the dragon!
I want my crown!
Ahh!
Look away, Khaleesi.
No.
No, Dany.
Dany, tell them.
Make them!
Dany, make them…
No, you can’t!
Just…
Please!
Dany, please!
A crown for a king.
Khaleesi?
He was no dragon.

“Summoned to court to answer for the crimes “of your bannerman Gregor Clegane, the Mountain.
” Er…
“Arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the crown.
” Poor Ned Stark.
Brave man, terrible judgment.
Attacking him was stupid.
Lannisters…
don’t act like fools.
Are you going to say something clever?
Go on, say something clever.
Catelyn Stark took my brother.
Why is he still alive?
Tyrion?
Ned Stark.
One of our men interfered, speared him through the leg before I could finish him.
Why is he still alive?
It wouldn’t have been clean.
Clean.
You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you.
I could care less what anyone thinks of me.
That’s what you want people to think of you.
It’s the truth.
When you hear them whispering “kingslayer” behind your back, doesn’t it bother you?
Of course it bothers me.
A lion doesn’t concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
I suppose I should be grateful that your vanity got in the way of your recklessness.
I’m giving you half of our forces , men.
You will bring them to Catelyn Stark’s girlhood home and remind her that Lannisters pay their debts.
I didn’t realise you placed such a high value on my brother’s life.
He’s a Lannister.
He might be the lowest of the Lannisters, but he’s one of us.
And every day that he remains a prisoner, the less our name commands respect.
So the lion does concern himself with the opinions of…
No, that’s not an opinion.
It’s a fact.
If another house can seize one of our own and hold him captive with impunity, we are no longer a house to be feared.
Your mother’s dead.
Before long I’ll be dead.
And you…
and your brother and your sister and all of her children.
All of us dead, all of us rotting in the ground.
It’s the family name that lives on.
It’s all that lives on.
Not your personal glory, not your honour, but family.
Do you understand?
Hmm.
You’re blessed with abilities that few men possess.
You’re blessed to belong to the most powerful family in the Kingdoms.
And you’re still blessed with youth.
And what have you done with these blessings, huh?
You’ve served as a glorified bodyguard for two kings one a madman, the other a drunk.
The future of our family will be determined in these next few months.
We could establish a dynasty that will last a thousand years.
Or we could collapse into nothing, as the Targaryens did.
I need you to become the man you were always meant to be.
Not next year.
Not tomorrow.
Now.
You’re in pain.
I’ve had worse, my lady.
Perhaps it’s time to go home.
The South doesn’t seem to agree with you.
I know the truth Jon Arryn died for.
Do you, Lord Stark?
Is that why you called me here, to pose me riddles?
Has he done this before?
Jaime would have killed him.
My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.
Your brother…
or your lover?
The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for years to keep bloodlines pure.
Jaime and I are more than brother and sister.
We shared a womb.
We came into this world together.
We belong together.
My son saw you with him.
Do you love your children?
With all my heart.
No more than I love mine.
And they’re all Jaime’s.
Thank the gods.
In the rare event that Robert leaves his whores for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed, I finish him off in other ways.
In the morning, he doesn’t remember.
You’ve always hated him.
Hated him?
I worshipped him.
Every girl in the Seven Kingdoms dreamed of him, but he was mine by oath.
And when I finally saw him on our wedding day in the Sept of Baelor, lean and fierce and blackbearded, it was the happiest moment of my life.
That night he crawled on top of me, stinking of wine, and did what he did, what little he could do, and whispered in my ear, “Lyanna.
” Your sister was a corpse and I was a living girl and he loved her more than me.
When the king returns from his hunt, I’ll tell him the truth.
You must be gone by then you and your children.
I will not have their blood on my hands.
Go as far away as you can, with as many men as you can.
Because wherever you go, Robert’s wrath will follow you.
And what of my wrath, Lord Stark?
You should have taken the realm for yourself.
Jaime told me about the day King’s Landing fell.
He was sitting in the Iron Throne and you made him give it up.
All you needed to do was climb the steps yourself.
Such a sad mistake.
I’ve made many mistakes in my life…
but that wasn’t one of them.
Oh, but it was.
When you play the game of thrones, you win…
or you die.
There is no middle ground.
Come here.
Oh, yes!
Oh, yes!
Oh!
Oh, yes!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Oh!
Oh, yes!
Oh, yes!
Oh!
No, no, no, no!
Is that what they teach you up in the North?
And you wherever you’re from do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound?
Either of you understand a thing that I’m saying?
Yes, my lord.
Let’s start over, shall we?
You be the man…
and you be the woman.
Well, go ahead.
Slowly.
You’re not fooling them.
They just paid you.
They know what you are.
They know it’s all just an act.
Your job is to make them forget what they know.
Now, that takes time.
You need to…
ease into it.
Go ahead.
Ease into it.
He’s winning you over in spite of yourself.
You’re starting to like this.
He wants to believe you.
He’s enjoyed his cock since he was old enough to play with it.
Why shouldn’t you?
He knows he’s better than other men.
He’s always known it deep down inside.
Now he has proof.
He’s so good, he’s reaching something deep inside of you that no one even knew was there, overcoming your very nature.
Why don’t you join us, my lord?
I’m saving myself for another.
What she doesn’t know won’t hurt her.
A stupid saying.
What we don’t know is usually what gets us killed.
She must be very beautiful.
No, not really.
Impeccable bloodlines though.
I do believe my lord’s in love.
For many years.
Most of my life, really.
Play with her arse.
And she loved me too.
I was her little confidant, her plaything.
She could tell me anything, anything at all.
She told me about all the horses that she liked, the castle that she wanted to live in and the man that she wanted to marry a Northerner…
with a jaw like an anvil.
So I challenged him to a duel.
I mean, why not?
I’d read all the stories.
The little hero always beats the big villain in all the stories.
In the end, she wouldn’t even let him kill me.
“He’s just a boy,” she said.
“Please don’t hurt him.
” So he gave me a nice little scar to remember him by, and off they went.
Is she still married to him?
Oh, no.
He got himself killed before the wedding…
…
and she ended up with his brother, an even more impressive specimen.
She loves him, I’m afraid.
And why wouldn’t she?
I mean, who could compare to him?
He’s just so…
…
good.
Do you know what I learned, losing that duel?
I learned that I’ll never win, not that way.
That’s their game, their rules.
I’m not going to fight them.
I’m going to fuck them.
That’s what I know.
That’s what I am.
And only by admitting what we are can we get what we want.
And what do you want?
Oh, everything, my dear.
Everything there is.
Now wash yourselves.
Both of you are working tonight.
Hmm.
You’re a very lucky girl.
Do you know that?
Where I come from, we don’t show mercy to criminals.
Where I come from, if someone like you attacked a little lord…
at low tide we’d lay you on your back on the beach, your hands and feet chained to four stakes.
The sea would come in closer and closer.
You’d see death creeping towards you a few inches at a time.
Where is it you come from?
The Iron Islands.
They far away?
You’ve never heard of the Iron Islands?
Trust me, you’ve never heard where I’m from neither.
“Trust me, my lord.
” You’re not living in the wilderness anymore.
In civilised lands, you refer to your betters by their proper titles.
And what’s that?
Lord.
Why?
Why?
What do you mean, why?
My father is Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands.
What’s that got to do with you?
If your father’s lord, how can you be lord too?
I will be lord after my father.
So you’re not lord now?
No, you…
Are you having a go at me?
Is that it?
I just don’t understand how you southerners do things.
I’m not a southerner.
You’re from south of the Wall.
That makes you a southerner to me.
You’re an impudent little wench, aren’t you?
Couldn’t say, my lord.
Don’t know what “impunent” means.
Impudent.
It means rude, disrespectful.
Do you want to lose that chain?
Theon Greyjoy!
The lady is our guest.
I thought she was our prisoner.
Are the two mutually exclusive in your experience?
Chances are I won’t be nearby the next time that happens.
I’m used to worse than him.
Hmm?
I’m used to men who could chew that boy up and pick their teeth with his bones.
Why did you come here?
Didn’t mean to come here.
Meant to get much further south than this.
As far south as south goes, before the long night comes.
Why?
What are you afraid of?
There’s things that sleep in the day and hunt at night.
Owls and shadowcats…
I’m not talking about owls and shadowcats.
The things you speak of they’ve been gone for thousands of years.
They wasn’t gone, old man.
They was sleeping.
And they ain’t sleeping no more.
I miss girls.
Not even talking to them.
I never talked to them.
Just looking at them, hearing them giggle.
Don’t you miss girls?
Riders.
The horn.
We have to blow the horn.
Why is he alone?
One blast for a ranger returning, two for wildlings, three for…
There’s no rider.
Whoa, boy, whoa.
That’s my Uncle Benjen’s horse.
Where’s my uncle?
Ned!
It’s Robert.
We were hunting…
a boar…
I should have spent more time with you, shown you how to be a man.
I was never meant to be a father.
Go on.
You don’t want to see this.
My fault.
Too much wine, missed my thrust.
It stinks.
It stinks like death.
Don’t think I can’t smell it.
I paid the bastard back, Ned.
I drove my knife right through his brain.
You ask ’em if I didn’t.
Ask ’em!
I want the funeral feast to be the biggest the Kingdoms ever saw.
And I want everyone to taste the boar that got me.
Now leave us, the lot of you.
I need to talk to Ned.
Robert, my sweet…
Out, all of you!
You damned fool.
Paper and ink on the table.
Write down what I say.
“In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, “first of…
” You know how it goes.
Fill in the damn titles.
“I hereby command “Eddard of House Stark…
” titles, titles…
“to serve as Lord Regent and Protector of the Realm “upon my death, “to rule in my stead “until my son Joffrey comes of age.
” Give it over.
Give it to the council…
after I’m dead.
At least they’ll say I did this right, this one thing.
You’ll rule now.
You’ll hate it worse than I did…
but you’ll do it well.
The girl…
Daenerys.
You were right.
Varys, Littlefinger, my brother…
worthless.
No one to tell me “no” but you.
Only you.
Let her live.
Stop it, if it’s not too late.
I will.
And my son…
help him, Ned.
Make him better than me.
I’ll…
I’ll do everything I can to honour your memory.
My memory.
King Robert Baratheon, murdered by a pig.
Give me something for the pain and let me die.
Give him milk of the poppy.
He was reeling from the wine.
He commanded us to…
step aside, but…
I failed him.
No man could have protected him from himself.
I wonder, Ser Barristan, who gave the king this wine?
His squire, from the king’s own skin.
His squire?
The Lannister boy?
Such a dutiful boy to make sure His Grace did not lack refreshment.
I do hope the poor lad does not blame himself.
His Grace has had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen.
Whatever arrangements you made…
unmake them.
At once.
I’m afraid those birds have flown.
The girl is likely dead already.
The stallion who mounts the world has no need for iron chairs.
According to the prophecy…
…
the stallion will ride to the ends of the earth.
The earth ends at the black salt sea.
No horse can cross the poison water.
The earth does not end at the sea…
…
there are many dirts beyond the sea.
The dirt where I was born.
Not dirts.
Lands.
Lands, yes…
There are thousands of ships in the free cities.
Wooden horses that fly across the sea…
Let’s speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs.
It’s not a chair.
It’s a…
…
throne.
Throne.
A chair for a King to sit upon, or…
…
a Queen.
A King does not need a chair to sit upon.
He only needs a horse.
Can’t you help me make him understand?
The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons.
Have patience, Khaleesi.
We will go home, I promise you.
My brother was a fool, I know, but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms.
Have I said something funny, ser?
Forgive me, Khaleesi, but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror didn’t seize six of the Kingdoms because they were his right.
He had no right to them.
He seized them because he could.
And because he had dragons.
Ah, well, having a few dragons makes things easier.
You don’t believe it.
Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi?
I believe what my eyes and ears report.
As for the rest…
it was years ago.
Who knows what really happened?
Now if you’ll pardon me, I’ll seek out the merchant captain, see if he has any letters for me.
I’ll come with you.
No, no, don’t trouble yourself.
Enjoy the market.
I’ll rejoin you soon enough.
Psst!
Jorah the Andal.
The Spider sends his greetings and his congratulations.
A royal pardon.
You can go home now.
Sweet reds…
I have sweet reds from Lys, Volantis and the Arbor!
Tyroshi pear brandy!
Andalish sours!
I have them!
I have them!
A taste for the Khaleesi?
I have a sweet red from Dorne, my lady.
One taste and you’ll name your first child after me.
My son already has his name, but I’ll try your summerwine.
Just a taste.
My lady, you are from Westeros.
You have the honour of addressing Daenerys of the House Targaryen, Khaleesi of the Riding Men and Princess of the Seven Kingdoms.
Princess.
Rise.
I’d still like to taste that wine.
That?
Dornish swill.
Not worthy of a princess.
I have a dry red from the Arbor nectar of the gods.
Let me give you a cask.
A…
A gift.
You honour me, ser.
The honour…
the honour is all mine.
Ahahahahah.
You know, there are many in your homeland that pray for your return, Princess.
I hope to repay your kindness someday.
Rakharo.
Put down that cask.
Is something wrong?
I have a thirst.
Open it.
The wine is for the khaleesi.
It’s not for the likes of you.
Open it.
Pour.
It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich without at least giving it time to breathe.
Do as he says.
As the princess commands.
Sweet, isn’t it?
Can you smell the fruit, ser?
Taste it, my lord.
Tell me that that is not the finest wine that has ever touched your tongue.
You first.
Me?
I’m afraid I am not worthy of the vintage.
Besides, it is a poor wine merchant who would drink up his own wares.
You will drink.
Stop him!
Come.
You came to us as outlaws…
…
poachers, rapers, killers, thieves.
You came alone, in chains, without friends or honour.
You came to us rich and you came to us poor.
Some of you bear the names of proud Houses, others only bastard names or no names at all.
It does not matter.
All that is in the past.
Here…
on the Wall…
we are all one House.
Tonight…
You’re allowed to look happy.
You’re going to be a ranger.
Isn’t that what you always wanted?
I want to find my uncle.
I know he’s alive out there.
I know he is.
I wish I could help you, but I’m no ranger.
It’s the steward’s life for me.
There’s honour in being a steward.
Not much, really.
But there’s food.
Here…
you begin anew.
A man of the Night’s Watch…
lives his life for the realm.
Not for a king…
or a lord, or the honour of this House or that House, not for gold or glory, or a woman’s love, but for the realm and all the people in it.
You’ve all learned the words of the vow.
Think carefully before you say them.
The penalty for desertion…
is death.
You can take your vows here…
tonight…
at sunset.
Do any of you still keep the old gods?
I do, my lord.
You’ll want to take your vow before a heart tree as your uncle did.
Yes, my lord.
You’ll find a weirwood a mile north of the Wall.
And your old gods too, maybe.
My lord, might I go as well?
Does House Tarly keep the old gods?
No, my lord.
I was named in the light of the Seven, as my father was and his father before him.
Why would you forsake the gods of your father and your House?
The Night’s Watch is my House now.
The Seven have never answered my prayers.
Perhaps the old gods will.
As you wish, lad.
You’ve all been assigned an order, according to our needs and your strengths.
Halder to the builders.
Pyp to the stewards.
Toad to the builders.
Grenn to the rangers.
Samwell to the stewards.
Matthar to the rangers.
Dareon to the stewards.
Balian to the rangers.
Rast to the rangers.
Jon to the stewards.
Rancer to the builder.
Echiel to the builders.
Gordo to the stewards.
Niko to the rangers.
Escan to the rangers.
Vorkoy to the builders.
Joby to the stables.
Mink to the kitchens.
Allo to the builders.
Nelugo to the rangers.
May all the gods preserve you.
Rangers with me.
Builders!
Samwell, you will assist me in the rookery and library.
Pyp, you will report to Bowen Marsh in the kitchens.
Luke, report to OneEyed Joe in the stables.
Dareon, we are sending you to Eastwatch.
Present yourself to Borcas when you arrive.
Make no comment about his nose.
Jon Snow, Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for his personal steward.
Will I serve the Lord Commander’s meals and fetch hot water for his bath?
Certainly.
And keep a fire burning in his chambers, change his sheets and blankets daily and do everything else the Lord Commander requires of you.
Do you take me for a servant?
We took you for a man of the Night’s Watch.
But perhaps we were wrong in that.
May I go?
As you wish.
Jon, wait!
Don’t you see what they’re doing?
I see Ser Alliser’s revenge, that’s all.
He wanted it and he got it.
Stewards are nothing but maids!
I’m a better swordsman and rider than any of you!
It’s not fair.
Fair?
I was singing for a high lord at Acorn Hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock.
I pushed him away and he said he’d have my hands cut off for stealing their silver.
So now I’m here at the end of the world with no one to sing for but old men and little shits like you.
I’ll never see my family again.
I’ll never be inside a woman again.
So don’t tell me about fair.
I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister.
Think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock?
Could you sing me a song, Pyp?
I’d like to hear a song.
Now listen to me.
The old man is the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch.
You’ll be with him day and night.
Yes, you’ll clean his clothes.
But you’ll also take his letters, attend him at meetings, squire for him in battle.
You’ll know everything, be part of everything.
And he asked for you himself.
He wants to groom you for command.
I just…
I always wanted to be a ranger.
I always wanted to be a wizard.
What?
No, I’m serious.
So you’ll stay and say your words with me?
Lord Stark…
a moment.
Alone, if you will.
He named you Protector of the Realm.
He did.
She won’t care.
Give me an hour and I can put a hundred swords at your command.
And what should I do with a hundred swords?
Strike!
Tonight, while the castle sleeps.
We must get Joffrey away from his mother and into our custody.
Protector of the Realm or no, he who holds the king holds the kingdom.
Every moment you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare.
By the time Robert dies, it will be too late for the both of us.
What about Stannis?
Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis?
You have odd notions about protecting the realm.
Stannis is your older brother.
This isn’t about the bloody line of succession.
That didn’t matter when you rebelled against the Mad King.
It shouldn’t matter now.
What’s best for the Kingdoms?
What’s best for the people we rule?
We all know what Stannis is.
He inspires no love or loyalty.
He’s not a king.
I am.
Stannis is a commander.
He’s led men into war twice.
He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet.
Yes, he’s a good soldier.
Everyone knows that.
So was Robert.
Tell me something.
Do you still believe good soldiers make good kings?
I will not dishonour Robert’s last hours by shedding blood in his halls…
and dragging frightened children from their beds.
You will sail to Dragonstone tonight.
You will place this in the hand of Stannis Baratheon.
Not his steward…
not his captain of the guard…
and not his wife.
Only Stannis himself.
Yes, my lord.
Now leave us.
My Lord Protector.
The king has no trueborn sons.
Joffrey and Tommen…
are Jaime Lannister’s bastards.
So when the king dies…
The throne passes to his brother…
Lord Stannis.
So it would seem.
Unless…
There is no “unless”.
He is the rightful heir.
Nothing can change that.
And he cannot take the throne without your help.
You would be wise to deny it to him and to make sure Joffrey succeeds.
Do you have a shred of honour?
You are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm.
All of the power is yours.
You need only…
reach out and take it.
Make peace with the Lannisters.
Release the Imp.
Wed your daughter to Joffrey.
We’ve plenty of time to get rid of Stannis, and if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems when he comes into his throne, we simply reveal his little secret and seat Lord Renly there instead.
We?
You’ll need someone to share these burdens, I assure you.
My price would be modest.
What you suggest is treason.
Only if we lose.
Make peace with the Lannisters, you say…
with the people who tried to murder my boy.
We only make peace with our enemies, my lord.
That’s why it’s called “making peace”.
No.
I won’t do it.
So it will be Stannis and war?
There is no other choice.
He is the heir.
So why did you call me here?
Not for my wisdom, clearly.
You promised Catelyn you would help me.
The queen has a dozen knights and a hundred menatarms enough to overwhelm what remains of my household guard.
I need the gold cloaks.
The City Watch is , strong…
and sworn to defend the king’s peace.
Look at you.
You know what you want me to do, you know it has to be done, but it’s not honourable, so…
the words stick in your throat.
When the queen proclaims one king and the Hand proclaims another, whose peace do the gold cloaks protect?
Who do they follow?
The man who pays them.
Hear my words and bear witness to my vow.
Night gathers and now my watch begins.
It shall not end until my death.
I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children.
I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.
I shall live and die at my post.
I am the sword in the darkness.
I am the watcher on the walls.
I am the shield that guards the realms of men.
I pledge my life and honour to the Night’s Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.
You knelt as boys.
Rise now as men of the Night’s Watch.
Well done.
Well done.
What’s he got there?
To me, Ghost.
Bring it here.
Gods be good!
What will they do to him?
When the khalasar rides, he’ll be leashed to a saddle and forced to run behind the horses for as long as he can.
And when he falls?
I saw a man last nine miles once.
King Robert still wants me dead.
This poisoner was the first.
He won’t be the last.
I thought he’d leave me alone now that my brother is gone.
He will never leave you alone.
If you ride to darkest Asshai, his assassins will follow you.
If you sailed all the way to the Basilisk Isles, his spies would tell him.
He will never abandon the hunt.
You’re a Targaryen the last Targaryen.
Your son will have Targaryen blood with , riders behind him.
He will not have my son.
He will not have you either, Khaleesi.
Moon of my life.
Are you hurt?
Jorah the Andal, I heard what you did.
Choose any horse you wish, it is yours.
I make this gift to you.
And to my son, the stallion who will mount the world, I will also pledge a gift.
I will give him the iron chair…
…
that his mother’s father sat upon.
I will give him Seven Kingdoms.
I, Drogo, will do this.
I will take my Khalasar west to where the world ends…
…
and ride wooden horses across the black salt water…
…
as no Khal has done before.
I will kill the men in iron suits…
…
and tear down their stone houses.
I will rape their women…
…
take their children as slaves…
…
and bring their broken gods back to Vaes Dothrak.
This, I vow…
…
I, Drogo, son of Bharbo.
I swear before the Mother of Mountains…
…
as the stars look down in witness.
As the stars look down in witness.
Lord Stark!
Stop!
No, all right.
It’s all right.
Let him through.
Lord Stark, King Joffrey and the Queen Regent request your presence in the Throne Room.
King Joffrey?
King Robert is gone.
The gods give him rest.
All is accomplished.
The City Watch is yours.
Good.
Is Lord Renly joining us?
I fear Lord Renly has left the city.
He rode through the Old Gate an hour before dawn with Ser Loras Tyrell and some retainers.
Last seen galloping south in some haste.
We stand behind you, Lord Stark.
All hail His Grace, Joffrey of Houses Baratheon and Lannister, the First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
I command the council to make all necessary arrangements for my coronation.
I wish to be crowned within the fortnight.
Today I shall accept oaths of fealty from my loyal councillors.
Ser Barristan…
I believe no man here could ever question your honour.
King Robert’s seal unbroken.
“Lord Eddard Stark is herein named…
“Protector of the Realm…
“to rule as regent…
“until the heir come of age.
” May I see that letter, Ser Barristan?
Protector of the Realm.
Is this meant to be your shield, Lord Stark?
A piece of paper?
Those were the king’s words.
We have a new king now.
Lord Eddard, when we last spoke you offered me some counsel.
Allow me to return the courtesy.
Bend the knee, my lord.
Bend the knee and swear loyalty to my son…
and we shall allow you to live out your days in the grey waste you call home.
Your son has no claim to the throne.
Liar!
You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark.
Ser Barristan, seize this traitor.
Ser Barristan is a good man, a loyal man.
Do him no harm.
You think he stands alone?
Kill him!
Kill all of them!
I command it!
Commander!
Take the queen and her children into custody.
Escort them back to the royal apartments and keep them there, under guard.
Men of the Watch!
I want no bloodshed.
Tell your men to lay down their swords.
No one needs to die.
Now!
I did warn you not to trust me.To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
Yah!
Left high, left low.
Right low, lunge right.
You break anything, the septa will have my head.
What is…
Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today.
How she could forget…
She didn’t forget.
She’s with her dancing master.
She’s with him every morning.
She always comes back with scrapes and bruises.
She’s so clumsy.
Hush!
Go back to your room.
Bar the doors and do not open them for anyone you do not know.
What is it?
What’s happening?
Do as I told you.
Run!
This way!
Left, right.
Rah!
Now you are dead.
You said right, but you went left.
And now you are a dead girl.
Only ’cause you lied.
My tongue lied.
My eyes shouted the truth.
You were not seeing.
I was so.
I watched, but you…
Watching is not seeing, dead girl.
The seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart of swordplay.
Arya Stark, come with us.
Your father wants to see you.
And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own?
I am wondering.
Mind your place, dancing master.
This is no concern of yours.
My father wouldn’t send you.
And I don’t have to go with you if I don’t want.
Take her.
Are you men or snakes, that you would threaten a child?
Get out of my way, little man.
I am Syrio Forel…
Foreign bastard.
…
and you will be speaking to me with more respect.
Kill the Braavosi.
Bring the girl.
Arya child, we are done with dancing for the day.
Run to your father.
Bloody oafs.
Begone now, Arya.
Come with me.
Run.
The first sword of Braavos does not run.
What do we say to the god of death?
Not today.
Go.
Not today.
Not today.
Stay away from me.
I’ll tell my father.
I’ll…
I’ll tell the queen.
Who do you think sent me?
Needle.
There she is.
What do you want?
I want you, wolf girl.
Come here.
Leave me be.
My father’s a lord.
He’ll reward you.
She’ll reward me the queen!
Stay away!
Lord Stark, you must be thirsty.
Varys.
I promise you it isn’t poisoned.
Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch?
Not so much, my lord.
I would save the rest, if I were you.
Hide it.
Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells.
What about my daughters?
The younger one seems to have escaped the castle.
Even my little birds cannot find her.
And Sansa?
Still engaged to Joffrey.
Cersei will keep her close.
The rest of your household though…
all dead, it grieves me to say.
I do so hate the sight of blood.
You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing.
And would again, my lord.
I was unarmed, unarmoured and surrounded by Lannister swords.
When you look at me do you see a hero?
What madness led you to tell the queen you had learned the truth about Joffrey’s birth?
The madness of mercy.
That she might save her children.
Ah, the children.
It’s always the innocents who suffer.
It wasn’t the wine that killed Robert, nor the boar.
The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open, but it was your mercy that killed the king.
I trust you know you’re a dead man, Lord Eddard?
The queen can’t kill me.
Cat holds her brother.
The wrong brother, sadly.
And lost to her.
Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers.
If that’s true, then slit my throat and be done with it.
Not today, my lord.
Tell me something, Varys.
Who do you truly serve?
The realm, my lord.
Someone must.
It’s Othor, without a doubt.
The other one is Jafer Flowers, my lord, less the hand the wolf tore off.
Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?
Just these two, my lord.
Been dead awhile, I’d say.
Mmm.
The smell.
What smell?
There is none.
If they’d been dead for a long time, wouldn’t there be rot?
We should burn them.
Snow’s not wrong, my lord.
Fire will do for them.
The wildling way.
I want Maester Aemon to examine them first.
You may be a coward, Tarly, but you’re not stupid.
Get them inside.
You heard him.
Lord Commander, Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers…
A raven from King’s Landing.
Come on, move ’em out.
Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself.
The king is dead.
Is there any word of my father?
Sit.
Lord Stark has been charged with treason.
They say he conspired with Robert’s brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.
I hope you’re not thinking of doing anything stupid.
Your duty lies here now.
My sisters were in King’s Landing too.
I’m sure they’ll be treated gently.
Your father has proved to be an awful traitor, dear.
King Robert’s body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffrey’s rightful throne.
He wouldn’t do that.
He knows how much I love Joffrey.
He wouldn’t.
Please, Your Grace, there’s been a mistake.
Send for my father.
He’ll tell you the king was his friend.
Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong.
We know that.
Yet you are the daughter of a traitor.
How can I allow you to marry my son?
A child born of a traitor’s seed is no fit consort for our king.
She is a sweet thing now, Your Grace, but in years who knows what treasons she may hatch?
No, I’m not.
I’ll be a good wife to him, you’ll see.
I’ll be a queen just like you, I promise.
I won’t hatch anything.
The girl is innocent, Your Grace.
She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty.
Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest, what’s his name?
Robb.
Word of your father’s arrest will reach him soon, no doubt.
Best it comes from you.
If you would help your father, urge your brother to keep the king’s peace.
Tell him to come to King’s Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey.
If…
If I could see my father, talk to him about…
You disappoint me, child.
We have told you of your father’s treason.
Why would you want to speak to a traitor?
I only meant that…
What will happen to him?
That depends.
On…
On what?
On your brother.
And on you.
Treason?
Sansa wrote this?
It is your sister’s hand, but the queen’s words.
You are summoned to King’s Landing to swear fealty to the new king.
Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his arse kissed?
This is a royal command, my lord.
If you should refuse to obey…
I won’t refuse.
His Grace summons me to King’s Landing, I’ll go to King’s Landing.
But not alone.
Call the banners.
All of them, my lord?
They’ve all sworn to defend my father, have they not?
They have.
Now we see what their words are worth.
Yes.
Are you afraid?
I must be.
Good.
Why is that good?
It means you’re not stupid.
You’ve had this since dawn?
He sent it to me, not you.
I’ve only shown it to you as a courtesy.
A courtesy?
!
My husband has been taken prisoner.
My son intends to declare war.
A war?
Your son against the Lannisters?
You should go to him.
Teach him patience.
Ned rots in a dungeon and you speak of patience?
He is your brother by law!
Does family mean nothing to you?
Family means everything to me.
And I will not risk Robin’s life to get caught up in another of your husband’s wars.
I’m hungry.
Hush now, darling.
You just ate.
You will not support us, then?
Do I understand you correctly?
But I’m hungry!
Soon, love, soon.
You’re always welcome here, sister.
But if you’re asking me to send men from the Vale to fight…
That is what I ask.
Go on, sweet.
Time for your bath.
I’ll feed you after.
If you fear for the safety of your son…
Of course I fear for the safety of my son!
Are you an idiot?
They killed my husband.
You say they shoved your boy from a window.
These people will do anything.
And that is why we have to stop them.
The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong, to protect their lord.
Will you shut up?
There’s hill tribes all around here.
If I’m going to die, it may as well be with a song in my heart.
I should just take your food and leave you here.
Eh?
What would you do then?
Starve, most likely.
You don’t think I’d do it, do you?
What do you want, Bronn?
Gold?
Women?
Golden women?
Stick with me and you’ll have them all, for as long as I’m around and not a moment longer.
But you knew that.
That is why you so valiantly took up arms to defend my honour.
Fair enough.
But don’t go looking for me to bend the knee and “my lord” you every time you take a shit.
I’m not your toady and I’m not your friend.
Though I would treasure your friendship, I’m mainly interested in your facility with murder.
And if the day ever comes when you’re tempted to sell me out, remember this whatever their price, I’ll beat it.
I like living.
Tyrion.
Tyrion.
Tyrion.
Come, share our fire.
Help yourselves to our goat.
When you meet your gods, you tell them Shagga, son of Dolf, of the Stone Crows sent you.
I am Tyrion, son of Tywin of Clan Lannister.
How would you like to die, Tyrion, son of Tywin?
In my own bed, at the age of with a belly full of wine and a girl’s mouth around my cock.
Take the halfman.
He can dance for the children.
Kill the other one.
No, no, no, no, no!
My…
My house is rich and powerful.
If you see us through these mountains, my father will shower you with gold.
We have no use for a halfman’s promises.
Halfman maybe, but at least I have the courage to face my enemies.
What do the Stone Crows do?
Hide behind rocks and shiver when the knights of the Vale ride by?
Are those the best weapons you could steal?
Good enough for killing sheep, if the sheep don’t fight back.
Lannister smiths shit better steel.
You think you can win us over with your trinkets?
That trinket is worth more than everything your tribe owns.
But if you help us, Shagga, son of Dolf, I will not give you trinkets.
I will give you this.
What is “this”?
The Vale of Arryn.
The lords of the Vale have always spat upon the hill tribes.
The lords of the Vale want me dead.
I believe it is time for new lords of the Vale.
Now there’s a rare sight…
Not only a bastard, but a traitor’s bastard.
Jon, no!
Jon, stop, put it down!
Blood will always tell.
You’ll hang for this, bastard.
I told you not to do anything stupid.
You’re confined to quarters.
Go.
Ghost, what’s wrong?
Is someone out there?
Commander?
Stay.
Hello?
Who’s there?
Lord Commander?
Snow?
Commander!
Move!
What did they do?
Lamb men make good slaves.
Khal Drogo will make a gift of them to the slavers, and the slavers will give us gold…
…
and silk, and steel.
I thought the Dothraki didn’t believe in money.
Gold to hire ships, Princess, ships to sail to Westeros.
Jorah, make them stop.
Khaleesi?
You heard me.
These men have shed blood for their khal.
Now they claim their rewards.
She is a lamb girl, Khaleesi.
The riders do her honour.
If her wailing offends the Khaleesi, I will bring you her tongue.
Princess, you have a gentle heart, but this is how it’s always been.
I do not have a gentle heart, ser.
Do as I command or Khal Drogo will know the reason why.
Come.
What do you want done with them?
Bring her to me.
And those women there.
You cannot claim them all, Princess.
I can, and I will.
Moon of my life, Mago says you haven taken his spoils, a daughter of a lamb man who was his to mount.
Tell me the truth of this.
Mago speaks the truth, my sun and stars.
I have claimed many daughters this day…
…
so they cannot be mounted.
This is the way of war.
These women are slaves now…
…
to do with as we please.
It pleases me to keep them safe.
If your riders would mount them, let them take them for wives.
Does the horse mate with the lamb?
The dragon feeds on horse and lamb alike.
You are a foreigner.
You do not command me.
I am Khaleesi.
I do command you.
See how fierce she grows?
That is my son inside her, the stallion that will mount the world, filling her with his fire.
I will hear no more.
Mago, find somewhere else to stick your cock.
A Khal who takes orders from a foreign whore is no Khal.
I will not have your body burned.
I will not give you that honour.
The beetles will feed on your eyes.
The worms will crawl through your lungs.
The rain will fall on your rotting skin…
…
until nothing is left of you but bones.
First you have to kill me.
I already have.
My sun and stars is wounded.
A scratch…
…
moon of my life.
Where are the healers?
This is the bite of a fly.
I can help the great rider with his cut.
The Khal needs no help from slaves who lie with sheep.
She is mine.
Let her speak.
Thank you, silver lady.
Who are you?
I am named Mirri Maz Duur.
I was the godswife of this temple.
Witch.
My mother was godswife here before me.
She taught me how to make healing smokes and ointments.
All men are of one flock, so my people believe.
The great shepherd sent me to earth to heal his…
Too many words.
A witch’s words poison the ears.
Lamb or lion, his wound must be washed and sewn or it will fester.
Let her clean your wound, my sun and stars…
…
it makes me hurt to see you bleed.
For years I’ve been making corpses out of men, boy.
I’m the man you want leading the vanguard.
Galbart Glover will lead the van.
The bloody wall will melt before an Umber marches behind a Glover.
I will lead the van or I will take my men and march them home.
You are welcome to do so, Lord Umber.
And when I am done with the Lannisters, I will march back north, root you out of your keep and hang you for an oathbreaker.
Oathbreaker, is it?
!
I’ll not sit here and swallow insults from a boy so green he pisses grass.
My lord father taught me it was death to bare steel against your liege lord.
But doubtless the Greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me.
Your meat…
is bloody tough.
What is it?
What’s happened?
Shh, it’s all right.
Where are you going?
South.
For Father.
But it’s the middle of the night.
The Lannisters have spies everywhere.
I don’t want them to know we’re coming.
They have more men than we do.
Aye, they do.
Can’t I come with you?
I can ride now.
You’ve seen me riding.
And I won’t get in the way, I…
There must always be a Stark at Winterfell.
Until I return that will be you.
You are not to leave the castle walls while we are gone.
Do you understand?
Listen to Maester Luwin.
Look after your little brother.
I will.
I’ll send letters whenever I can, but if you don’t hear from me, don’t be scared.
Until I return.
How long have you been hiding out there?
Robb will be looking for you to say goodbye.
They’ve all gone away.
They’ll be back soon.
Robb will free Father and they’ll come back with Mother.
No, they won’t.
Please watch over Robb.
And watch over all the other men from Winterfell.
And Theon too, I suppose.
You hear them, boy?
The old gods are answering you.
What are you doing here?
They’re my gods too.
Beyond the Wall, they’re the only gods.
Even slaves are allowed to pray.
You’re not a slave.
Well, your friend did put a knife to my throat.
I’m not complaining, little lord, just telling truths.
What did you mean about hearing the gods?
You asked them, they’re answering you.
Shh.
Open your ears.
It’s only the wind.
Who do you think sends the wind if not the gods?
They see you, boy.
They hear you.
Your brother will get no help from them where he’s going.
The old gods have no power in the South.
The weirwoods there were all cut down a long time ago.
How can they watch when they have no eyes?
Well, there’s a big man.
He has giants’ blood in him or I’m the queen.
Go back and find your clothes, Hodor.
Go dress.
Hodor.
Are there really giants beyond the wall?
Giants and worse than giants.
I tried telling your brother, he’s marching the wrong way.
All these swords, they should be going north, boy.
North, not south!
The cold winds are rising.
They were touched by white walkers.
That’s why they came back.
That’s why their eyes turned blue.
Only fire will stop them.
How do you know that?
I read about it in a book…
a very old book in Maester Aemon’s library.
What else did the book say?
The white walkers sleep beneath the ice for thousands of years.
And when they wake up…
And when they wake up, what?
I hope the Wall’s high enough.
Summer snows, my lady.
Robb’s brought the North with him.
The river lords are falling back with Jaime Lannister at their heels.
And Lord Tywin is bringing around a second Lannister army from the South.
Our scouts confirm it’s even larger than the Kingslayer’s.
One army or two, the kings in the North threw back hosts times as large.
Mother!
You look well.
Lady Catelyn, you’re a welcome sight in these troubled times.
We had thought not to meet you here, my lady.
I had not thought to be here.
I would speak with my son alone.
I know you will forgive me, my lords.
You heard her!
Move your arses!
Come on, out.
You too, Greyjoy.
Are you bloody deaf?
Have no fear, my lady.
We’ll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister’s bunghole and then it’s on to the Red Keep to free Ned.
You old devil, Rodrik.
Jon.
You’re not wasting away, are you?
I remember the day you came into this world, redfaced and squalling.
And now I find you leading a host to war.
There was no one else.
No one?
Who were those men I saw here?
None of them are Starks.
All of them are seasoned in battle.
If you think you can send me back to Winterfell…
Oh, would that I could.
There was…
a letter.
From Sansa.
From the queen, you mean.
There’s no mention of Arya.
No.
How many men do you have?
,.
If I go to King’s Landing and bend my knee to Joffrey…
You would never be allowed to leave.
No.
Our best hope, our only hope, is that you can defeat them in the field.
And if I lose?
Do you know what happened to the Targaryen children when the Mad King fell?
They were butchered in their sleep.
On the orders of Tywin Lannister.
And the years have not made him kinder.
If you lose, your father dies, your sisters die, we die.
Well, that makes it simple, then.
I suppose it does.
From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
Best for Tyrion, son of Tywin.
Not best for me.
If the halfman betrays us, Shagga, son of Dolf, will cut off his manhood…
And feed it to the goats, yes.
All right, then.
Time to meet my father.
Tyrion.
Uncle.
Father.
The rumours of your demise were unfounded.
Sorry to disappoint you.
And who are these…
companions of yours?
This is Shagga, son of Dolf, chieftain of the Stone Crows.
Timett, son of Timett, ruler of the Burned Men.
This fair maid is Chella, daughter of Cheyk, leader of the Black Ears.
And here we have Bronn, son of…
You wouldn’t know him.
May I present my lord father, Tywin, son of Tytos of House Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West?
Kind of you to go to war for me.
You left us no choice.
The honour of the house was at stake.
Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly.
We have our differences, Jaime and I.
He’s braver.
I’m betterlooking.
He’s been covering himself in glory.
Jaime smashed the river lords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun, Catelyn Stark’s homeland.
And the Starks?
Lord Eddard?
Is our hostage.
He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell.
How did my sweet sister persuade the king to imprison his dear friend Ned?
Robert Baratheon is dead.
Joffrey rules in King’s Landing.
My sister rules, you mean.
Stark’s son has called his banners.
He moves south with a strong host.
A green boy.
One taste of battle and he’ll run back to Winterfell with his tail between his legs.
Maybe.
Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.
You’d like him.
While we’re on the subject of war, I made promises to my friends here, and a Lannister always pays his debts.
We shall require , helms and shields, plus swords, pikes, gorgets, maces…
If it please my lord, Ser Addam bids me report that the northmen have crossed the Neck.
The wolf rushes into the lion’s jaws.
So be it.
Kevan, command the drummers beat assembly.
And send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark.
At once, my lord.
It is said that the men of the mountain clans are great warriors.
Ride with me against my enemies and you shall have all my son promised you and more.
Only if the halfman fights with us.
Until we hold the steel he pledged us, the little lion’s life is ours.
The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north.
We need to get him on broken ground, put his knights at a disadvantage.
No, we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannister’s siege of Riverrun.
Do that and the river lords will join us.
To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at the Twins.
Lord Frey controls that bridge.
Your father’s bannerman.
“The late Lord Frey” my father calls him.
At the Trident, he didn’t appear until the battle was done.
Some men take their oaths more seriously than others.
Robb’s right.
We need that bridge.
So what’s it going to be?
Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin?
Your pardon, my lords.
We’ve captured a Lannister scout.
Don’t worry, lad.
He won’t be leaving this tent with his head.
Where did you find him?
In the brush above the encampment.
He looked to be counting.
How high did you get?
,.
Maybe more.
You don’t have to do this yourself.
Your father would understand…
My father understands mercy, when there is room for it.
And he understands honour…
and courage.
Let him go.
Robb.
Tell Lord Tywin winter is coming for him.
, northerners marching south to find out if he really does shit gold.
Yes, my lord.
Thank you, my lord.
Are you touched, boy?
!
Letting him go?
You call me boy again.
Go on.
Oi.
It is also the wish of His Grace that his loyal servant Janos Slynt, Commander of the City Watch…
Ser Aron.
…
be at once raised to the rank of lord…
Lord Gyles.
…
and granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honour after him until the end of time.
In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark, it is the wish of His Grace that Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, be appointed Hand of the King.
Lastly, in these times of treason and turmoil, it is the view of council that the life and safety of King Joffrey be of paramount importance.
Ser Barristan Selmy.
Your Grace, I am yours to command.
Rise, Ser Barristan.
You may remove your helm.
You have served the realm long and faithfully.
Every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks.
But it is time to put aside your armour and your sword.
It is time to rest and look back with pride on your many years of service.
Your Grace, the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood.
Our vows are taken for life.
Only death relieves us of our sacred trust.
Whose death, Ser Barristan?
Yours or your king’s?
You let my father die.
You’re too old to protect anybody.
Your Grace…
The council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
The man who profaned his blade with the blood of the king he had sworn to defend!
Careful, ser.
We have nothing but gratitude for your long service, good ser.
You shall be given a stout keep beside the sea, with servants to look after your every need.
A hall to die in and men to bury me.
I am a knight.
I shall die a knight.
A naked knight, apparently.
Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake!
Here, boy!
Melt it down and add it to the others.
If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence.
Your Grace.
Come forward, my lady.
The Lady Sansa of House Stark.
Do you have some business for the king and the council, Sansa?
I do.
As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father, Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King.
Treason is a noxious weed.
It should be torn out, root…
Let her speak.
I want to hear what she says.
Thank you, Your Grace.
Do you deny your father’s crime?
No, my lords.
I know he must be punished.
All I ask is mercy.
I know my lord father must regret what he did.
He was King Robert’s friend and he loved him.
You all know he loved him.
He never wanted to be Hand until the king asked him.
They must have lied to him Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody.
They must have lied!
He said I wasn’t the king.
Why did he say that?
He was badly hurt.
Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy.
He wasn’t himself.
Otherwise he never would have said it.
A child’s faith.
Such sweet innocence.
And yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes.
Treason is treason!
Anything else?
If you still have any affection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace.
Your sweet words have moved me.
But your father has to confess.
He has to confess and say that I’m the king…
or there’ll be no mercy for him.
He will.To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
You’ve seen better days, my lord.
Another visit?
It seems you’re my last friend.
No, no, many still love you.
Sansa came to court this morning to plead for your life.
On her knees begging for me.
Hm!
Did you laugh with the others?
You do me wrong, my lord.
Your blood is the last thing I want.
I don’t know what you want.
I’ve given up trying to guess.
When I was still a boy before they cut my balls off with a hot knife I travelled with a group of actors through the free cities.
They taught me that each man has a role to play.
The same is true at court.
I am the master of whisperers.
My role is to be sly, obsequious and without scruples.
I’m a good actor, my lord.
Huh.
Can you free me from this pit?
I could.
But will I?
No.
As I said, I’m no hero.
What do you want?
Tell me.
No riddles, no stories…
Tell me, what do you want?
Peace.
Did you know that your son is marching south with an army of northmen?
Loyal lad.
Fighting for his father’s freedom.
Robb?
He’s just a boy.
Boys have been conquerors before.
But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights is the king’s…
the late king’s brother.
Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne.
He is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy.
Stannis Baratheon is Robert’s true heir.
The throne is his by rights.
Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life.
It would be a shame to throw it away.
Cersei is no fool.
She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one.
You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, who butchered my men, who crippled my son?
I want you to serve the realm!
Tell the queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir.
Cersei knows you as a man of honour.
If you give her the peace she needs, and promise to carry her secret to your grave, I believe she will allow you to take the black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son.
You think my life is some precious thing to me?
That I would trade my honour for a few more years of…
Of what?
You grew up with actors.
You learned their craft and you learnt it well.
But I grew up with soldiers.
I learned how to die a long time ago.
Pity.
Such a pity.
What of your daughter’s life, my lord?
Is that a precious thing to you?
It’s a birthday message to his grandniece Walda.
Or so Walder Frey would have you think.
Keep shooting them down.
We can’t risk Lord Walder sending word of your movements to the Lannisters.
He’s Grandfather’s bannerman.
We can’t expect his support?
Expect nothing of Walder Frey and you’ll never be surprised.
Look.
Father rots in a dungeon.
How long before they take his head?
We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now.
Just march up to his gates and tell him you’re crossing.
We’ve got five times his numbers.
You can take the Twins if you have to.
Not in time.
Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.
The Freys have held the crossing for years, and for years they have never failed to exact their toll.
Have my horse saddled and ready.
Enter the Twins alone and he’ll sell you to the Lannisters as he likes.
Or throw you in a dungeon.
Or slit your throat.
My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing.
Whatever it took.
If I’m going to lead this army, I can’t have other men doing my bargaining for me.
I agree.
I’ll go.
You can’t!
I have known Lord Walder since I was a girl.
He would never harm me.
Unless there was a profit in it.
What do you want?
It is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, my lord.
Oh, spare me.
Your boy’s too proud to come before me himself.
What am I supposed to do with you?
Father, you forget yourself.
Lady Stark is here…
Who asked you?
You’re not Lord Frey yet, not until I die.
Do I look dead to you?
Father, please…
I need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard?
Your mother would still be a milkmaid if I hadn’t squirted you into her belly.
All right, you come forward.
There.
Now that I’ve observed the courtesies, perhaps my sons will do me the honour of shutting their mouths.
Is there somewhere we can talk?
We’re talking right now.
Fine.
Out!
All of you!
Oh!
You too.
You see that?
Fifteen, she is.
A little flower.
And her honey’s all mine.
I’m sure she will give you many sons.
Huh.
Your father didn’t come to the wedding.
He is quite ill, my lord.
Huh.
Didn’t come to the last one, either.
Or the one before that.
Your family has always pissed on me.
My lord, I…
Don’t deny it.
You know it’s true.
The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine.
I’m sure there were reasons…
I didn’t need reasons.
I needed to get rid of sons and daughters.
You see how they pile up?
Why are you here?
To ask you…
to open your gates, my lord…
so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way.
Why should I let him?
If you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has , men outside your walls.
They’ll be , corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here.
Don’t try and frighten me, Lady Stark.
Your husband’s in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your son’s got no fur to keep his balls warm.
You swore an oath to my father.
Oh, yes, I said some words.
And I swore oaths to the crown too, if I remember right.
Joffrey’s king now, which makes your boy and his corpsestobe nothing but rebels, it seems to me.
If I had the sense the gods gave a fish, I’d hand you both over to the Lannisters.
Why don’t you?
Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon.
Give me one good reason why I should waste a single thought on any of you?
And…
engage!
When does Aemon think you’ll be able to use that hand?
Soon, he says.
Good.
You’ll be ready for this, then.
I thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear…
so I had a new pommel made.
It’s called Longclaw.
Works as well for a wolf as a bear, I think.
This is Valyrian steel.
It was my father’s sword, his father before him.
The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries.
It was meant for my son Jorah.
He brought dishonour to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros.
My lord, you honour me, but I can’t…
Oh, you can.
And you will.
I wouldn’t be standing here if it wasn’t for you and your beast.
A bloody dead man tried to kill me.
So you’ll take it.
I’ll hear no more about it.
Is that understood?
Yes, my lord.
Right.
Now, don’t think this means I approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne.
That’s a man’s sword.
It’ll take a man to wield it.
I’ll apologise to Ser Alliser tonight.
No, you won’t.
I sent him to King’s Landing yesterday.
The hand that your wolf tore off that thing’s wrist…
I’ve, uh, ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this…
boy king.
That should get young Joffrey’s attention.
And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne.
Now go and put your sword somewhere safe…
and bring me my supper.
Yes, my lord.
Well done.
Well done.
You earned that, Snow.
Well done.
Go on, let’s have a look.
At what?
The sword!
Show us the sword.
Sword!
Sword!
Sword!
Sword!
Sword!
Sword!
Sword!
Sword!
Sword!
Let’s have a look.
Piss off.
Come on, I want to have a look at it in the light.
Give it here!
What is it?
I…
Look at its eyes.
Give it.
I can’t.
You can’t what?
I…
I’m really not supposed to say.
And yet you really want to say.
You want to say that?
There was a raven.
I read the message to Maester Aemon.
It’s your brother Robb.
What?
What about him?
He’s heading south.
To war.
All his bannermen have rallied to his side.
They’ll keep him safe.
I should be there.
I should be with him.
If we do that, they’ll never get back across.
Well?
What did he say?
Lord Walder has granted your crossing.
His men are yours, as well.
Huh.
Less the he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you.
What does he want in return?
You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire.
He expects a knighthood in good time.
Fine, fine.
And?
And Arya…
will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age.
She won’t be happy about that.
Hm.
And?
And…
when the fighting is done…
you will marry one of his daughters.
Whichever you prefer.
He has a number he thinks will be…
suitable.
I see.
Did you get a look at his daughters?
I did.
And?
One was…
Do you consent?
Can I refuse?
Not if you want to cross.
Then I consent.
Sam said you wanted to see me?
I did indeed.
Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me.
Tell me, did you ever wonder why the men of the Night’s Watch take no wives and father no children?
No.
So they will not love.
Love is the death of duty.
If the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose…
between honour on the one hand…
and those he loves on the other, what would he do?
He…
He would do whatever was right.
No matter what.
Then Lord Stark is one man in ,.
Most of us are not so strong.
What is honour…
compared to a woman’s love?
And what is duty…
against the feel of a newborn son in your arms?
Or a brother’s smile?
Sam told you.
We’re all human.
Oh, we all do our duty when there’s no cost to it.
Honour comes easy then.
Yet…
sooner or later…
in every man’s life…
there comes a day when it is not easy.
A day when he must choose.
And this is my day?
Is that what you’re saying?
Oh, it hurts, boy.
Oh, yes.
I know.
You do not know.
No one knows.
I may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother.
The gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows.
They waited till I was old.
What could I do when the ravens brought the news from the South…
the ruin of my House, the death of my family?
I was helpless…
blind, frail.
But…
when I heard they had killed my brother’s son…
and his poor son…
and the children!
Even the little children.
Who are you?
My father was Maekar, the first of his name.
My brother Aegon reigned after him…
when I had refused the throne.
And he was followed by his son Aerys…
whom they called the Mad King.
You’re Aemon Targaryen.
I’m a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the Night’s Watch.
I will not tell you…
to stay or go.
You must make that choice yourself…
and live with it for the rest of your days.
As I have.
My lord…
My sun and stars…
Drogo.
My horse…
Blood of my blood…
No, I must ride.
He fell from his horse.
A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.
He’s tired, that’s all.
He needs to rest.
We’ve ridden far enough today.
We’ll camp here.
This is no place to camp.
A woman does not give us orders.
Not even a Khaleesi.
We’ll camp here.
Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.
You do not command me Khaleesi.
Find Mirri Maz Duur.
Bring her to me.
The witch?
I’ll bring you her head, Khaleesi.
Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me.
Hyah!
Hyah!
Our scouts tell us the Stark host has moved south from the Twins with Lord Frey’s levies in tow.
They’re a day’s march north.
The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless…
provincial courage.
Ah.
Oh, do continue.
Didn’t mean to interrupt.
I do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise we’ve wasted good steel on them.
The great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes.
Heavy black steel, doublesided.
Shagga likes axes.
When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard.
The vanguard?
Mmhm.
Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?
They do seem rather ferocious.
Ferocious?
Last night…
a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage.
Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat.
Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man’s cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.
When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander.
Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.
There’ll be no more discussion on the matter.
It appears I’m not hungry after all.
Excuse me, my lords.
Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?
I took her.
Took her?
From whom?
From, uh…
Ser…
What’s his name?
I don’t know.
Ginger cunt, three tents down.
And he didn’t have anything to say about it?
He said something.
Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically.
We’ll be at the vanguard tomorrow.
Oh, well.
I, uh…
think I’ll go and find myself one.
Who are you?
Who would you like me to be?
What did your mother call you?
Shae.
What did your mother call you?
My mother died giving birth to me.
Is that why I’m here?
So we can talk about our mothers?
What sort of accent is that?
Foreign.
For…
What do you want from me?
What do I want from you?
I want you to share my tent.
I want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they’re sore after a day’s ride.
I want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we’re together.
And I want you to fuck me like it’s my last night in this world.
Which it may well be.
And what do I get?
One safety.
No one will hurt you for as long as you’re mine.
Two the pleasure of my company, which I have heard is spectacular.
Who told you this?
Women you paid?
And three…
more gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years.
Do you accept my proposal?
Let’s start with your last night in this world.
Khaleesi.
Come.
He’s very strong.
No one understands how strong he is.
He will die tonight, Khaleesi.
He can’t.
He can’t.
I won’t let him.
Even a queen doesn’t have that power.
We must go quickly.
I’ve heard there’s a good port in Asshai.
I won’t leave him.
He’s already gone, Khaleesi.
Doth…
Even if…
Even if he dies…
why would I run?
I am khaleesi, and my…
my son will be khal after Drogo.
This isn’t Westeros, where men honour blood.
Here they only honour strength.
There will be fighting after Drogo dies.
Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal.
He won’t want any rivals.
Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs.
I won’t…
leave him.
The wound has festered.
You did this witch.
Stop it!
I don’t want her hurt.
No?
No?
You don’t want her hurt?
Pray we don’t hurt you, too.
You let this witch put her hands on our Khal.
Rein in your tongue.
She is still your Khaleesi.
Only while the blood of my blood lives.
When he dies, she is nothing.
I have never been nothing.
I am the blood of the dragon.
The dragons are all dead, Khaleesi.
I think you should wear your armour tonight, ser.
I think you’re right.
You’ve saved me once more.
And now you must save him.
He’s beyond the healer’s skills.
All I can do is ease his path.
Save him and I will free you.
I swear it.
You must know a way.
Some…
Some magic.
There is a spell.
Some would say death is cleaner.
Do it.
Save him.
There is a price.
You’ll have gold, whatever you want.
It’s not a matter of gold.
This is bloodmagic.
Only death pays for life.
My death?
No, not your death, Khaleesi.
Bring me his horse.
Khaleesi, do not do this thing.
Let me kill this witch.
Kill her and you kill your khal.
This is bloodmagic.
It is forbidden.
I am your khaleesi.
I tell you what is forbidden.
Go.
Now.
Take her and leave.
Uhuh.
Take her!
You must go also, lady.
Once I begin to sing, no one must enter the tent.
The dead will dance here tonight.
No one will enter.
Bring him back to me.
What have you done?
I have to save him.
We could have been miles away from here by now, on the way to Asshai.
You would have been safe.
This must not be.
This must be.
Witch.
No, you can’t.
Khaleesi!
No further, horselord.
Are you hurt?
The baby…
Hmm?
…
is coming.
Fetch the midwives.
They will not come.
They say she is cursed.
They’ll come or I’ll have their heads.
The witch she can bring baby.
I hear her say so.
Are you in agony, my lion?
No.
You look like you’re in agony.
The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.
Ah!
Damn you, woman.
Are you immune to pain?
Just used to it.
Drink.
Let’s play a new game.
There’s a Braavosi knife game I could teach you.
Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?
Not if you win.
No!
No fire games, no knife games.
Let’s do something I’m good at.
What are you good at?
I happen to be a great judge of character.
This sounds like a boring game.
It’s not.
Here’s how it works I make a statement about your past.
If I’m right, you drink.
If I’m wrong, I drink.
And no lying.
I’ll know if you’re lying.
I don’t want to play this game.
Fine.
Bronn first.
Your father beat you.
But my mother hit harder.
You killed your first man before you were .
It was a woman.
She swung an axe at me.
You’ve been north of the Wall.
What brought you up there?
Work.
And…
you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you’ve never let yourself love again.
Oh, wait, that’s me.
Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty.
I don’t want to play.
It’s fun!
Look at the fun we’re having.
Your mother was a whore.
Drink.
All right.
Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return.
Drink.
And we’ve established the rules about lying?
Drink!
Mm.
You wanted a different life.
You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.
The whole shitstained world could drink off that one.
So, specifics…
You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there?
I don’t believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you.
So…
what’s a lowborn girl to do?
Drink.
Are you sure…
Drink!
And don’t talk about my mother and father ever, or I will carve your eyes from your head.
My dear lady, if I have offended you, I apologise.
My turn.
Fine, fine.
Ask away.
Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.
Who were you in love with?
That’s not how the game works.
I don’t care the way the game works.
Our lord here used to be married.
Married?
How did you hear that?
You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.
Another night, perhaps.
Not another night.
This night.
It’s not a pleasant story.
Oh, maybe I will cry.
I’m guessing the lady and I can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship.
So…
I was .
My brother Jaime and I were riding, when we heard a scream.
She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels.
Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while I wrapped her in my cloak.
She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers I took her to the nearest inn and fed her.
Her name was Tysha.
She was a wheelwright’s orphan.
And she was hungry.
Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine.
Impossible as it seems, there was a time when I was unaccustomed to wine.
I forgot how afraid I was around girls…
how I was always waiting for them to laugh at me or…
look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother.
I forgot about everything but Tysha.
And somehow I found myself in her bed.
For three chickens, I should hope so.
It didn’t last long.
I didn’t know what the hell I was doing.
But she was good to me.
She kissed me afterwards and…
sang me a song.
And by morning I was deep enough in love to ask for her hand.
A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it man and wife.
For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father.
Well, I imagine that was the end of all that.
Not quite.
First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth.
The girl was a whore, you see.
Jaime had arranged the whole thing the road, the rapers…
all of it.
He thought it was time I had a woman.
After my brother confessed…
my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards.
He paid her well a silver for each man.
How many whores command that kind of price?
He brought me into the barracks and made me watch.
By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor.
I would have killed the man who did that to me.
You should have known she was a whore.
Really?
I was , drunk and in love.
A girl who was almost raped doesn’t invite another man into her bed two hours later.
As I said, I was young and stupid.
You are still young and stupid.
Hyah!
What is it?
What do you want?
You’re sleeping through the war.
What?
They stole a night’s march on us.
They’re a mile north.
Get my squire!
You don’t have a squire.
If I die, weep for me.
You’ll be dead.
How will you know?
I’ll know.
Watch out!
Move!
Out of the way!
Move aside!
Stay low.
Stay low?
If you’re lucky, no one will notice you.
I was born lucky.
Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round!
Stone Crows!
Black Ears!
Burned Men!
Moon Brothers!
And Painted Dogs!
And Painted Dogs!
Painted Dogs!
Your dominion over the Vale begins now!
Onward, to claim what is yours!
Half man!
Half man!
Half man!
Half man!
Half man!
Half man!
To battle!
You’re a shit warrior.
I’m alive?
You’re alive.
Did we win?
We wouldn’t be having this conversation if we didn’t.
How did our tribesmen do?
Yeah, good.
It’s nice to see them getting along.
You’re wounded.
Good of you to notice.
I hear we won.
Huh!
The scouts were wrong.
There were , Stark bannermen, not .
Did we get the Stark boy, at least?
He wasn’t here.
Where was he?
With his other , men.
And where are they?
We should go, my lady.
No!
My lady!
Hyah!
Hyah!
By the time they knew what was happening, it had already happened.
Lady Stark.
I’d offer you my sword, but I seem to have lost it.
It is not your sword I want.
Give me my daughters back.
Give me my husband.
I’ve lost them too, I’m afraid.
Kill him, Robb.
Send his head to his father.
He cut down ten of our men.
You saw him.
He’s more use to us alive than dead.
Take him away and put him in irons.
We could end this war right now, boy, save thousands of lives.
You fight for the Starks, I fight for the Lannisters.
Swords or lances, teeth, nails choose your weapons and let’s end this here and now.
If we do it your way, kingslayer…
you’d win.
We’re not doing it your way.
Come on, pretty man.
I sent , men to their graves today.
The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.
Aye.
But the dead won’t hear them.
One victory does not make us conquerors.
Did we free my father?
Did we rescue my sisters from the queen?
Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees?
This war is far from over.
Could I have one?
A lemon one…
or any of them.
Three coppers.
How about a nice fat pigeon?
Oh, piss off now.
Go on.
Do you have any stale ones from yesterday?
Or any burnt ones?
Piss off!
Hey, where’s everyone going?
What’s happening?
They’re taking him to the Sept of Baelor.
Who?
The Hand of the King.
Traitor!
Coward!
Baelor.
Baelor!
Traitor!
Traitor!
I am Eddard Stark…
Lord of Winterfell…
and Hand of the King.
I come before you to confess my treason…
in the sight of gods and men.
I betrayed the faith of my king…
and the trust of my friend Robert.
I swore to protect and defend his children.
But before his blood was cold…
I plotted to murder his son…
and seize the throne for myself.
Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed bear witness to what I say…
Joffrey Baratheon…
is the one true heir to the Iron Throne…
by the grace of all the gods, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms…
and Protector of the Realm.
As…
As we sin…
so do we suffer.
This man has confessed his crimes…
in sight of gods and men.
The gods are just…
but beloved Baelor taught us…
they can also be merciful.
What is to be done with this traitor, Your Grace?
My mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join the Night’s Watch.
Stripped of all titles and powers, he would serve the realm in permanent exile.
And my Lady Sansa…
has begged mercy for her father.
But they have the soft hearts of women.
So long as I am your king…
treason shall never go unpunished.
Ser Ilyn…
bring me his head!
No!
Someone stop him!
My son, this is madness.
Put him down!
Don’t look!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Shut your mouth!
Look at me!
Look at me!
Stop!
Daddy!
Stop!
No!
No!
Traitor!
Stop!
Stop him!

Look at me.
Look at me!
Do you remember me now, boy, eh?
Remember me?
There’s a bright boy.
You’ll be coming with me, boy, and you’ll be keeping your mouth shut.
Keep your mouth shut, boy.
I’m not a boy!
You’re not a smart boy, is that what you’re trying to say?
Do you want to live, boy?
!
North, boy, we’re going north.
It had three eyes.
It told me to come with him, so I did.
We went down into the crypts and my father was there.
Your father’s not down there, little lord.
Not for many years yet.
You’re afraid.
Just like Hodor.
I’m not afraid of some hole in the ground.
You’ve lived beyond the Wall.
What are you scared of?
I’m a crippled boy and I’m willing to go.
That’s my grandfather, Lord Rickard.
He was burned alive by the Mad King, Aerys.
That’s Lyanna, my father’s sister.
King Robert was supposed to marry her, but Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped her.
Robert started a war to win her back.
He killed Rhaegar, but she died anyway.
That’s where I saw Father.
You see?
He’s not here.
Here, Shaggydog.
Rickon!
That beast is supposed to be chained in the kennels!
He doesn’t like chains.
What are you doing down here?
Come back up with us.
No, I came to see Father.
How many times have I told you?
He’s in King’s Landing with Sansa and Arya.
He was down here.
I saw him.
Saw him when?
Last night, when I was sleeping.
Here, Shaggydog.
You both miss him.
It’s only natural he should be in your thoughts and dreams, but that doesn’t mean that…
Bran…
My lady.
My lady.
My lady.
My lady.
My lady.
My lady.
My lady.
Robb.
Robb.
Robb!
You’ve ruined your sword.
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
I’ll kill them all.
Every one of them.
Shh.
I will kill them all.
My boy.
They have your sisters.
We have to get the girls back.
And then we will kill them all.
# The boar’s great tusks, they boded ill
# For good King Robert’s health
# And the beast was every bit as fat
# As Robert was himself
# But our brave king cried, “Do your worst!
# “I’ll have your ugly head!
# “You’re nowhere near as murd’rous as…
# “The lion in my bed”
# King Robert lost his battle and…
# He failed his final test
#The lion ripped his balls off, and…
# The boar did all the rest #
Very amusing.
Isn’t it a funny song?
Thank you for your rendition.
I imagine it was even better received at that tavern.
I’m so sorry, Your Grace.
I’ll never sing it again, I swear.
Tell me, which do you favour your fingers or your tongue?
Your Grace?
Fingers or your tongue?
If you got to keep one, which would it be?
Or I could just cut your throat.
Every man needs hands, Your Grace.
Good.
Tongue it is.
Your Grace, please.
I won’t sing, Your Grace.
Ser Ilyn, who better than you to carry out the sentence?
I beg you!
Please, no.
No!
Your Grace, please.
I beg you, I will never sing again!
I’m done for the day.
No!
I’ll leave the rest of the matters to you, Mother.
Your Grace, please!
You look quite nice.
Thank you, my lord.
“Your Grace.
” I’m King now.
Stop!
No!
Walk with me.
I want to show you something.
Do as you’re bid, child.
…
and as soon as you’ve had your blood, I’ll put a son in you.
Mother says that shouldn’t be long.
No!
Please, no!
This one’s your father.
This one here.
Look at it and see what happens to traitors.
You promised to be merciful.
I was.
I gave him a clean death.
Look at him.
Please let me go home.
I won’t do any treason, I swear…
Mother says I’m still to marry you.
So you’ll stay here…
and obey.
Look at him!
Well?
How long do I have to look?
As long as it pleases me.
Do you want to see the rest?
If it please Your Grace.
That’s your Septa there.
I’ll tell you what, I’m going to give you a present.
After I raise my armies and kill your traitor brother, I’m going to give you his head as well.
Or maybe he’ll give me yours.
My mother tells me a king should never strike his lady.
Ser Meryn.
Here, girl.
Will you obey now?
Or do you need another lesson?
I’ll look for you in court.
Save yourself some pain, girl.
Give him what he wants.
You’ll be needing that again.
The proper course is clear pledge fealty to King Renly and move south to join our forces with his.
Renly is not the king.
You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord.
He put your father to death.
That doesn’t make Renly king.
He’s Robert’s youngest brother.
If Bran can’t be Lord of Winterfell before me, Renly can’t be king before Stannis.
Do you mean to declare us for Stannis?
Renly is not right!
My lords.
If we put ourselves behind Stannis…
My lords!
Here is what I say to these two kings.
Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither.
Why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in the South?
What do they know of the Wall or the Wolfswood?
Even their gods are wrong!
Why shouldn’t we rule ourselves again?
It was the dragons we bowed to…
and now the dragons are dead!
There sits the only king I mean to bend my knee to the King in the North!
I’ll have peace on those terms.
They can keep their Red Castle and their iron chair too.
The King in the North!
Am I your brother, now and always?
Now and always.
My sword is yours…
in victory and defeat, from this day until my last day.
The King in the North!
The King in the North!
The King in the North!
The King in the North!
The King in the North!
The King in the North!
The King in the North!
The King in the North!
The King in the North!
The King in the North!
The King in the North!
The King in the North!
The King in the North!
Lady Stark.
I want to see him.
Now!
Leave us.
You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark.
Widowhood becomes you.
Your bed must be lonely.
Is that why you came?
I’m not at my best, but I think I could be of service.
You slip out of that gown and we’ll see if I’m up to it.
Oh, I do like a violent woman.
I will kill you tonight, ser…
pack your head in a box and send it to your sister.
Let me show you how…
Hit me again, over the ear.
And again and again.
You’re stronger than you look.
It shouldn’t take long.
That is what you want the world to believe, isn’t it?
That you don’t fear death.
But I don’t, my lady.
The dark is coming for all of us.
Why cry about it?
Because you are going to the deepest of the seven hells, if the gods are just.
What gods are those?
The trees your husband prayed to?
Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off?
If your gods are real and if they are just…
why is the world so full of injustice?
Because of men like you.
There are no men like me.
Only me.
My son Bran.
How did he come to fall from that tower?
I pushed him out the window.
Why?
I…
hoped the fall would kill him.
Why?
You should get some sleep.
It’s going to be a long war.
I can’t believe we’re actually at war.
Was it this exciting last time, when you were young?
What does it say?
Have we captured Robb Stark yet?
What’s our next move?
Stop talking.
Get back into bed.
They have my son.
The Stark boy appears to be less green than we’d hoped.
I’ve heard his wolf killed a dozen men and as many horses.
Is it true about Stannis and Renly?
Both Baratheon brothers have taken up against us.
Jaime captured, his armies scattered…
It’s a catastrophe.
Perhaps we should sue for peace.
There’s your peace.
Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark’s head.
You’ll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now.
He’s winning…
in case you hadn’t noticed.
I’m told we still have his sisters.
The first order of business is ransoming Ser Jaime.
No truces.
We can’t afford to look weak.
We should march on them at once.
First we must return to Casterly Rock to raise…
They have my son!
Get out, all of you.
Not you.
You were right about Eddard Stark.
If he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Robert’s brothers.
But now…
Madness.
Madness and stupidity.
I always thought you were a stunted fool.
Perhaps I was wrong.
Half wrong.
I’m new to strategy, but…
Unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can’t stay here.
No one will stay here.
Ser Gregor will head out with riders and set the Riverland on fire from God’s Eye to the Red Fork.
The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal.
And you will go to King’s Landing.
And do what?
Rule.
You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead.
You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be.
And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest Baelish, Varys, Pycelle…
Heads, spikes, walls.
Why not my uncle?
Why not anyone?
Why me?
You’re my son.
Oh, one more thing.
You will not take that whore to court.
Do you understand?
Ser Jorah?
Gently, gently.
My son…
Where is he?
I want him.
Where is he?
The boy did not live.
Tell me.
What is there to tell?
How did my son die?
He never lived, my princess.
The women say…
What do the women say?
They say the child was…
Monstrous, twisted.
I pulled him out myself.
He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with leather wings like the wings of a bat.
When I touched him the skin fell from his bones.
Inside…
he was full of graveworms.
I warned you that only death can pay for life.
You knew the price.
Where is Khal Drogo?
Show him to me.
Show me what I bought with my son’s life.
As you command, lady.
Come.
I will take you to him.
Time enough for that later…
I want to see him now.
The khalasar is gone.
A khal who cannot ride is no khal.
The Dothraki follow only the strong.
I’m sorry, my Princess.
Drogo!
My sun and stars.
Why is he out here alone?
He seems to like the warmth, Princess.
He lives.
You asked for life, you paid for life.
This is not life.
When will he be as he was?
When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east.
When the seas go dry.
When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.
Leave us.
I don’t want you alone with this sorceress.
I have nothing more to fear from this woman.
Go.
You knew what I was buying and you knew the price.
It was wrong of them to burn my temple.
It angered the Great Shepherd.
This is not God’s work.
My child was innocent.
Innocent?
He would have been the stallion who mounts the world.
Now he will burn no cities.
Now his khalasar will trample no nations into dust.
I spoke for you.
I saved you.
Saved me?
Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me, girl.
I saw my god’s house burn, there where I had healed men and women beyond counting.
In the streets I saw piles of heads…
the head of the baker who makes my bread, the head of a young boy that I had cured of fever just three moons past.
So…
tell me again exactly what it was that you saved?
Your life.
Why don’t you take a look at your khal…
Then you will see exactly what life is worth…
when all the rest has gone.
You can’t!
Get out of my way, Sam.
They’ll put out the word.
They’ll send out ravens.
People will come after you.
Do you know what happens to deserters?
Better than you do.
What are you going to do?
I’m gonna find my brother and put a sword through King Joffrey’s throat.
You can’t leave us now.
We need you here.
Move.
I won’t let you go.
Move.
No.
Hyah!
Hand of the King?
So it would seem.
And your father said you couldn’t take anyone with you to King’s Landing?
No, he said I couldn’t take you with me to King’s Landing.
He was very specific on that point.
He knew my name?
What?
He said, “Don’t bring Shae with you to King’s Landing”?
I believe he used the word “whore”.
Are you ashamed of me?
Are you afraid that I’m dancing around the court with my tits out?
I’m funny now?
I’m Shae, the funny whore.
My father’s probably the most powerful man in the country.
Certainly the richest.
He has all seven kingdoms in his pockets.
Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says.
He’s always been a cunt.
I believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you.
Why don’t you come with me, be the Hand’s lady?
Because the king needs a Hand and the Hand…
I know what a Hand needs.
Ghost?
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Samwell!
Is he dead?
No, he’s not dead.
Did we get him?
Come on, help me get him up.
Lucky you’ve got plenty of padding.
We’re taking you back to where you belong.
I belong with my brother.
But we’re your brothers now.
They’ll kill you if they find out you’ve gone.
They’ll kill you if they know you came after me.
Go back.
Sam told us everything.
We’re sorry about your father.
But it doesn’t matter.
You took the oath.
You can’t leave.
I have to.
You can’t.
You said the words.
I don’t care about…
“Hear my words and bear witness to my vow…
” To hell with all of you.
“Night gathers and now my watch begins.
“It shall not end until my death.
“I shall live and die at my post.
” “I am the sword in the darkness…
” “The watcher on the walls…
” “The shield that guards the realms of men.
“I pledge my life and honour to the Night’s Watch, “for this night and all nights to come.
” Do you remember our first ride, my sun and stars?
If you are in there, if you haven’t gone away, show me.
You’re a fighter.
You’ve always been a fighter.
I need you to fight now.
I know you’re very far away, but come back to me, my sun and stars.
When the sun…
rises in the west…
…
and sets in the east…
…
then you shall return to me, my sun and stars.
Kings?
Oh, I can tell you all there is to know about kings.
The thing you need to understand about kings is…
For the past years, I’ve known…
truly known…
more kings than any man alive.
They’re complicated men, but I know how to serve them.
Yes.
And keep on serving them.
Aerys Targaryen.
Of all the thousand thousand maladies the gods visit on us…
madness is the worst.
He was a good man.
Such a charmer.
To watch him melt away before my eyes…
consumed by dreams of fire and blood…
Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal powerful man, great warrior but alas, winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom are rather different things.
They say that…
if a man goes through life with his battle visor down, he can often be blind to the enemies at his side.
Now I serve his son…
King Joffrey…
may the gods bless his reign.
He is a capable young man strong military mind.
Stern.
But sternness in defence of the realm is no vice.
It’s far too soon to know what manner of king he will be, but…
I sense true greatness on the horizon for our new king.
Mmm.
True greatness.
So what’s the thing?
What thing?
About kings.
You said, “The thing you need to understand about kings…
” What?
Things?
What?
When you started, you…
Never mind.
Let me see you out, my dear.
It’s all right.
No need.
Yes, yes.
Till the next time.
Right.
When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look?
Does the crown fit?
Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years?
It’s hard for them to simper and bow without heads.
A man with great ambition and no morals I wouldn’t bet against you.
And what would you do, my friend, if you found yourself sitting up there?
I must be one of the few men in this city who doesn’t want to be King.
You must be one of the few men in the city who isn’t a man.
Oh, you can do better than that.
When they castrated you, did they take the pillar with the stones?
I’ve always wondered.
Have you?
Do you spend a lot of time wondering what’s between my legs?
I picture…
a gash.
Like a woman’s.
Is that about right?
I am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all.
Must be strange for you, even after all these years…
a man from another land, despised by most, feared by all…
Am I?
That is good to know.
Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash?
But you carry on…
whispering in one king’s ear and then the next.
I admire you.
And I admire you, Lord Baelish.
A grasper from a minor House with a major talent for befriending powerful men…
and women.
A useful talent, I’m sure you’d agree.
So…
here we stand…
in mutual admiration and respect.
Playing our roles.
Serving a new king.
Long may he reign.
My king.
My king.
My lords.
Shall we begin?
You’re Arry now, hear me?
Arry the orphan boy.
No one asks an orphan too many questions, cos nobody gives three shits.
What’s your name?
Arry.
You’ve a long way to travel, and in bad company.
I’ve this time men and boys all bound for the Wall.
Your lord father gave me the pick of the dungeons, and I didn’t find no little lordlings down there.
This lot half of them would turn you over to the king quick as spit for a pardon.
And the other half would do the same, except they’d rape you first.
So keep to yourself and when you piss, do it in the woods alone.
You stay with this lot, boy.
And stay…
or I’ll lock you in the back of the wagon with these three.
Watch yourself, midget.
He’s got a sword, this one.
What’s a gutter rat like you doing with a sword?
Maybe he’s a little squire.
He ain’t no squire.
Look at him.
He looks like a girl.
I bet he stole that sword.
Let’s have a look.
I could use me a sword like that.
Take it off him.
Give it here, midget.
Look at him.
You’d better give Hot Pie the sword.
I’ve seen him kick a boy to death.
I knocked him down and I kicked him in the balls and I kept kicking him until he was dead.
I kicked him all to pieces.
You better give me that sword!
You want it?
I’ll give it to you.
I already killed one fat boy.
I bet you never killed anyone.
I bet you’re a liar.
But I’m not.
I’m good at killing fat boys.
I like killing fat boys.
Like picking on the little ones, do you?
I’ve been hammering an anvil these past years.
When I hit that steel, it sings.
Are you gonna sing when I hit you?
This is castleforged steel.
Where’d you steal it?
It was a gift.
It don’t matter now.
Where we’re going, they don’t care what you’ve done.
They’ve got rapers, pickpockets, highwaymen…
murderers.
Which are you?
Armourer’s apprentice.
But my master got sick of me, so…
here I am.
Come on, you sorry sons of whores!
It’s a thousand leagues from here to the Wall!
And winter is coming!
Ham.
How many days in a row must a man be expected to start his day with ham?
Bring me some beer at least.
You look exhausted.
Was your moonlight ride that tiring?
Don’t look so terrified.
If we beheaded everyone that ran away for the night, only ghosts would guard the Wall.
At least you weren’t whoring in Mole’s Town.
Honour made you leave, honour brought you back.
My friends brought me back.
I didn’t say it was your honour.
They killed my father.
And you’re gonna bring him back to life?
No?
Good.
We’ve had enough of that sort of thing.
Beyond the Wall, the Rangers are reporting whole villages abandoned.
At night they see fires blazing in the mountains from dusk until dawn.
A captured wildling swears their tribes are uniting in some secret stronghold, to what ends the gods only know.
Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke’s men discovered four blueeyed corpses.
Unlike us, they were wise enough to burn them.
Do you think your brother’s war is more important than ours?
No.
When dead men and worse come hunting for us in the night, do you think it matters who sits on the Iron Throne?
No.
Good.
Because I want you and your wolf with us when we ride out beyond the Wall tomorrow.
Beyond the Wall?
I’ll not sit meekly by…
and wait for the snows.
I mean to find out what’s happening.
The Night’s Watch will ride in force against the wildlings, the white walkers and whatever else is out there.
And we will find Benjen Stark, alive or dead.
I will command them myself.
So I’ll only ask you once, Lord Snow…
Move out!
…
are you a brother of the Night’s Watch or a bastard boy who wants to play at war?
Is this your command, Khaleesi?
Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs in the Night Lands.
Sell them.
You can return to the free cities and live as a wealthy woman for all your days.
They were not given to me to sell.
Khaleesi, my Queen…
I vow to serve you, obey you, to die for you if need be…
but let him go, Khaleesi.
I know what you intend.
Do not.
I must.
You don’t understand…
Don’t ask me to stand aside as you climb on that pyre.
I won’t watch you burn.
Is that what you fear?
You will be my khalasar.
I see the faces of slaves.
I free you.
Take off your collars.
Go if you wish, no one will stop you.
But if you stay…
it will be as brothers and sisters, as husbands and wives.
Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre.
You swore to obey me.
I am Daenerys Stormborn…
of House Targaryen…
of the blood of old Valyria.
I am the Dragon’s Daughter.
And I swear to you…
that those who would harm you will die screaming.
You will not hear me scream.
I will.
But it is not your screams I want.
Only your life.
Blood of my blood.To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
Well struck.
Well struck, dog.
Did you like that?
It was well struck, Your Grace.
I already said it was well struck.
Yes, Your Grace.
Who’s next?
Lothor Brune, freerider in the service of Lord Baelish.
Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard.
Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard!
Here I am.
Here I am.
Sorry, Your Grace.
My deepest apologies.
Are you drunk?
No.
No.
No, Your Grace.
I had two cups of wine.
Two cups?
That’s not much at all.
Please, have another cup.
Are you sure, Your Grace?
Yes.
To celebrate my name day.
Have two.
Have as much as you like.
I would be honoured, Your Grace.
Ser Meryn, help Ser Dontos celebrate my name day.
See that he drinks his fill.
You can’t.
What did you say?
Did you say I can’t?
I only meant it would be bad luck to kill a man on your name day.
What kind of stupid peasant’s superstition…
The girl is right.
What a man sows on his name day, he reaps all year.
Take him away.
I’ll have him killed tomorrow, the fool.
He is a fool.
You’re so clever to see it.
He’ll make a much better fool than a knight.
He doesn’t deserve the mercy of a quick death.
Did you hear my lady, Ser Dontos?
From this day, you’ll be my new fool.
Thank you, Your Grace.
And you, my lady, thank you.
Beloved nephew.
We looked for you on the battlefield.
You were nowhere to be found.
I’ve been here, ruling the kingdoms.
What a fine job you’ve done.
Look at you.
More beautiful than ever.
And you!
You’re going to be bigger than the Hound, but much better looking.
This one doesn’t like me.
Can’t imagine why.
We heard you were dead.
I’m glad you’re not dead.
Me, too, dear.
Death is so boring, especially now, with so much excitement in the world.
My lady, I’m sorry for your loss.
Her loss?
Her father was a confessed traitor.
But still her father.
Surely, having so recently lost your own beloved father, you can sympathise.
My father was a traitor.
My mother and brother are traitors, too.
I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey.
Of course you are.
Well, enjoy your name day, Your Grace.
Wish I could stay and celebrate, but there is work to be done.
What work?
Why are you here?
A raven arrived from the citadel this morning, Your Grace.
The conclave has met, considered reports from maesters all over the Seven Kingdoms, and declared this great summer done at last.
The longest summer in living memory.
The peasants say, a long summer means an even longer winter.
A common superstition.
We have enough wheat for a fiveyear winter.
If it lasts any longer, we’ll have fewer peasants.
The city’s drowning in refugees, Your Grace, fleeing the war.
We have nowhere to house them.
And with winter coming, it’ll only get worse.
You command the city watch, do you not, Lord Slynt?
I do, Your Grace.
And are you not a lord at my command?
I owe my title and lands to your generosity, Your Grace.
Then do your job.
Shut the gates to the peasants.
They belong in the field, not our capital.
Yes, Your Grace.
Don’t get up.
More ravishing than ever, big sister.
War agrees with you.
Forgive the interruption.
Carry on.
What are you doing here?
It’s been a remarkable journey.
I pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell, I fought with the hill tribes.
So many adventures, so much to be thankful for.
What are you doing here?
This is the small council.
Yes, well, I do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings.
Our father is Hand of the King.
Yes, but in his absence…
Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as hand in his stead while he fights.
Out!
All of you out!
I would like to know how you tricked Father into this.
If I were capable of tricking Father, I’d be emperor of the world by now.
You brought this on yourself.
I’ve done nothing.
Quite right, you did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark’s head.
Now the entire North has risen up against us.
I tried to stop it.
Did you?
You failed.
That bit of theatre will haunt our family for a generation.
Robb Stark is a child.
Who’s won every battle he’s fought.
Do you understand we’re losing the war?
What do you know about warfare?
Nothing.
But I know people.
And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us.
Joffrey is king.
Joffrey is king.
You are here to advise him.
I’m only here to advise him.
And if the king listens to what I say, the king might just get his Uncle Jaime back.
How?
You love your children.
It’s your one redeeming quality.
That and your cheekbones.
The Starks love their children as well.
And we have two of them.
One.
One?
Arya, little animal, she disappeared.
Disappeared?
What, in a puff of smoke?
We had three Starks to trade.
You chopped one’s head off and let another escape.
Father will be furious.
It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child.
My lord, may the old gods watch over your brother and all our Northern sons.
The walls of my holdfast will not stand the winter.
The stones were last mortared in the time of King Aerys, and I’m afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers’ hammers.
When I was a boy, I remember seeing them put up a new tower at Torrhen’s Square in a summer.
Men worked back then.
Today, my holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children.
At night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps.
Gods forbid it rains.
Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall.
Maintenance of a holdfast generally falls to the lord of that holdfast.
Generally, yes, but I’ve sent all the young men off to fight Robb Stark’s war.
King Robb.
And it’s not his war.
He didn’t choose it.
Maybe not, my lord, but he called in his banners and took the men.
Joffrey killed my father, your liege lord.
Do you remember your vows, ser?
Of course I remember!
We can spare four masons for a week, my lord.
Will that be sufficient to repair your walls?
I believe it will.
We didn’t want him here all day, did we?
I didn’t like the way he was talking about Robb.
Nor did I.
But listening to people you’d rather not listen to is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell.
Lord Portan.
My lord, may the old gods watch over your brother and all our Northern sons.
Boil this for an hour and drink the tea.
Makes all your pain go away.
Don’t have any pain.
Lucky for you.
That way.
You’ve been having those dreams again.
I don’t dream.
Everyone dreams.
I don’t.
Heard some of the men talking about the comet.
They say it’s an omen.
They say it means Robb will win a great victory in the South.
Did they?
I heard some other fools say it’s Lannister Red.
Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long.
Heard a stable boy say it’s the colour of blood to mark the death of your father.
The stars don’t fall for men.
Red comet means one thing, boy.
Dragons.
The dragons are all dead.
They’ve been dead for centuries.
Mmm.
What did your brother say about them, Khaleesi?
He said they ate meat.
He didn’t tell you what kind of meat?
My brother didn’t know anything about dragons.
He didn’t know anything about anything.
Eh.
She was Drogo’s first gift to me.
I remember.
I promised to protect them.
Promised them their enemies would die screaming.
How do I make starvation scream?
A trick I never learned, I’m afraid.
Does it ever end?
This is further east than I’ve ever been.
But, yes, Khaleesi, everything ends, even the Red Waste.
And you’re sure there’s no other way?
If we go south to the land of the Lhazareen, the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons.
If we go west to the Dothraki Sea, the first khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons.
No one will take my dragons.
They are too weak to fight, as are your people.
You must be their strength.
As you are mine.
Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro.
Take our remaining horses.
You will ride east, you southeast, and you northeast.
What do we seek, Khaleesi?
Cities, living or dead.
Caravans and people.
Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea.
Find how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side.
Rakharo.
You are my last hope, blood of my blood.
I will not fail you, blood of my blood.
You never have.
This is bad time to start.
Having a rough time of it?
Nothing’s killed me yet.
Your arse killed the sledge.
You offered me a ride.
I just wanted you to shut up about your damn blisters.
I was born in a place like this.
Later, I fell on hard times.
Are those girls?
Craster’s daughters.
I haven’t seen a girl in six months.
I’d keep on not seeing them if I were you.
What, he don’t like people messing with his daughters?
He don’t like people messing with his wives.
He marries his daughters, and they give him more daughters.
And on and on it goes.
That’s foul.
It’s beyond foul.
All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared.
Craster’s still here.
He must be doing something right.
What happens to the boys?
Hmm?
He marries his daughters.
What does he do with his sons?
He said he planned to stop here on his way to the Frostfangs.
People make all sorts of plans.
I haven’t seen Benjen Stark in three years.
Haven’t missed him.
Always treated me like scum.
Haven’t had any good wine for a long time.
You Southerners make good wine, I’ll give you that.
We’re not Southerners.
Who’s this little girl?
You’re prettier than half my daughters.
You got a nice wet twat between your legs?
What’s your name?
Jon Snow.
Snow, eh?
Listen to me, bastard.
All you lot from south of the Wall, you’re Southerners.
But now you’re in the North, the real North.
The lad meant no harm.
I catch that pretty little bastard talking to my daughters…
No one will talk to your daughters, you have my word.
Now, sit down and shut your mouth.
You bring any of that good wine with you?
We did.
We passed through six villages on the way here.
All six were abandoned.
Where have all the wildlings gone?
I could tell you, but I’m thirsty.
There’s a barrel of Dornish wine on the sledge.
Bring it in here.
Yes, Commander.
You want to know where they’ve all gone?
North, to join up with Mance Rayder.
Your old friend.
He’s no friend of mine.
He broke his vows, betrayed his brothers.
Aye.
But once he was just a poor black crow.
And now he’s KingbeyondtheWall.
He’s been calling himself that for years.
What’s he king of?
A frozen lake somewhere?
That’s a goodlooking axe.
Fresh forged?
Give it here.
You’ll have another one made at Castle Black.
Here.
That’s some lovely steel.
You want to know what Mance Rayder is doing?
Gathering an army.
What I hear, he’s already got more men than any of your Southern Kings.
And where does he plan marching this army?
When you’re all the way north, there’s only one direction to go.
These are bad times to be living alone in the wild.
The cold winds are rising.
Let them come.
My roots are sunk deep.
Wife, tell the Lord Crow how content we are.
This is our place.
Our husband keeps us safe.
Better to live free than die a slave.
Don’t it make you jealous, old man, to see me with all these young wives and you with no one to warm your bed?
We chose different paths.
Aye, and you chose the path with no one but boys on it.
You’ll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof, I suppose, and eat me out of pigs.
A roof would be welcome.
It’s been hard riding.
We’ve brought our own food and good steel for you.
Any man lays a hand on one of my wives, he loses the hand.
And I see this one staring too long, I might just gouge his eyes out.
Your roof, your rules.
Who am I?
Who am I?
Lord Commander.
And who are you?
Jon Snow.
Who are you?
Your steward.
You want to lead one day?
Then learn how to follow.
Lord of Light, come to us in our darkness.
We offer you these false gods.
Take them and cast your light upon us, for the night is dark and full of terrors.
For the night is dark and full of terrors.
After the long summer, darkness will fall heavy on the world.
The stars will bleed.
We need to stop her.
The cold breath of winter will freeze the seas…
Not now.
…
and the dead shall rise in the North.
All you men were named in the light of the Seven!
Is this how you treat the gods of your fathers?
Are you so eager to spit on your ancestors?
You smell of fear, fear and piss and old bones.
Do you want to stop me?
Stop me.
In the ancient books, it’s written that a warrior will draw a burning sword from the fire.
And that sword shall be Lightbringer.
Stannis Baratheon, Warrior of Light, your sword awaits you.
Lord, cast your light upon us!
For the night is dark and full of terrors.
For the night is dark and full of terror.
This woman will lead him into a war he cannot win.
Stannis is our king.
We follow where he leads, even if we don’t like the path.
King.
Since that boar killed his brother, every lord wants a coronation.
I don’t serve the others.
I serve Stannis.
As do I, but loyal service means telling hard truths.
He’s surrounded by fools and fanatics, but he trusts you, Davos.
If you tell him the truth…
What’s the truth?
“And I declare upon the honour of my house that my beloved brother Robert…
” He wasn’t my beloved brother.
I didn’t love him.
He didn’t love me.
A harmless courtesy, Your Grace.
A lie.
Take it out.
“That my brother Robert left no trueborn heirs, “the boy Joffrey, the boy Tommen, and the girl Myrcella being born of incest “between Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime Lannister.
“By right of birth…
” Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.
Call him what he is.
“And her brother Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.
” “By right of birth and blood, I do this day lay claim…
” Make it Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.
Whatever else he is, the man’s still a knight.
“Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.
“By right of birth and blood, “I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of Westeros.
“Let all true men declare their loyalty.
” When Eddard Stark learned the truth, he told only me.
I’ll not make the same mistake.
Send copies of that letter to every corner of the realm, from the Arbor to the Wall.
The time has come to choose.
Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse.
Your Grace, the Lannisters are the true enemy.
If, for the time being, you could make peace with your brother…
I’ll not make peace with Renly while he calls himself king.
Well, many have already declared for him, Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly.
Stannis does not need to beg this lord or that lord for support.
The Lord of Light stands behind him.
And how many ships has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?
He has no need for ships.
I’m sure he doesn’t, but we do if we’re going to war.
If not Renly, Your Grace, join forces with Robb Stark.
Who would steal the northern half of my kingdom.
I’ve always served thieves according to their deserts, as you well know, Ser Davos.
Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark, they’re all thieves.
They’ll bend the knee or I’ll destroy them.
I owe you an apology, my king.
My duty is to serve.
You have chosen the new god over the old gods.
May the Lord of Light watch over us all.
Shall we drink together?
Don’t.
A cup of wine to honour the one true god.
The night is dark and full of terrors, old man, but the fire burns them all away.
King in the North.
I keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping, but you drag me along from camp to camp.
Have you grown fond of me, Stark?
Is that it?
I’ve never seen you with a girl.
If I left you with one of my bannermen, your father would know within a fortnight and my bannerman would receive a raven with a message, “Release my son and you’ll be rich beyond your dreams.
“Refuse and your house will be destroyed, root and stem.
” You don’t trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle?
Oh, I trust them with my life, just not with yours.
Smart boy.
What’s wrong?
Don’t like being called “boy”?
Insulted?
You insult yourself, Kingslayer.
You’ve been defeated by a boy.
You’re held captive by a boy.
Perhaps you’ll be killed by a boy.
Stannis Baratheon sent ravens to all the high lords of Westeros.
King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king nor a true Baratheon.
He’s your bastard son.
If that’s true, Stannis is the rightful king.
How convenient for him.
My father learned the truth.
That’s why you had him executed.
I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head.
Your son killed him so the world wouldn’t learn who fathered him.
And you, you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen.
You have proof?
Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives?
I’m sending one of your cousins down to King’s Landing with my peace terms.
You think my father’s going to negotiate with you?
You don’t know him very well.
No, but he’s starting to know me.
Three victories don’t make you a conqueror.
It’s better than three defeats.
This city stinks.
Like dead bodies.
A bit corpsey, yes.
And shit.
I thought you wanted to come here.
I love it.
You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?
And cum and garlic and rum.
You can smell cum from the balcony?
I love the stink.
I love the noise.
Cities make me want to fuck.
And so did the country.
This is where I belong.
Yes, well, you need to be careful.
No one can know you’re here.
No one will know.
You can’t trust anyone in King’s Landing.
They’re all liars, good liars, bad liars, one or two great liars.
What about you?
Me?
I’m not from here.
I’m a slave to the truth.
Truth?
You are the biggest little liar I have ever met.
Why do you think I am so little?
I’m being crushed beneath the weight of all that truth.
Ned Stark actually slept on this.
As if the poor man didn’t suffer enough.
One of the many changes we’ll have to make around here.
Lord Baelish.
Your Grace.
I wonder if I might ask you for a favour.
Of course, Your Grace.
Ned Stark’s youngest daughter Arya, we can’t seem to locate her.
If she’s escaped the capital, Winterfell seems the logical destination.
And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her.
Curious.
If we choose to negotiate with the Starks, the girl has some value.
Whoever finds her…
Well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts.
Well, you could ask Varys where she is.
He’ll have an answer for you.
Whether you believe it…
Myself, I have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs.
Who knows what they want?
A mockingbird.
You created your own sigil, didn’t you?
Yes.
Appropriate, for a selfmade man with so many songs to sing.
I’m glad you like it.
Some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family.
Others have to find their own way.
I heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family.
He loved the eldest daughter.
Sadly, she had eyes for another.
When boys and girls live in the same home, awkward situations can arise.
Sometimes, I’ve heard, even brothers and sisters develop certain affections.
And when those affections become common knowledge, well, that is an awkward situation indeed, especially in a prominent family.
But prominent families often forget a simple truth, I’ve found.
And which truth is that?
Knowledge is power.
Seize him.
Cut his throat.
Stop.
Wait.
I’ve changed my mind.
Let him go.
Step back three paces.
Turn around.
Close your eyes.
Power is power.
Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me.
I would very much appreciate it.
You’re Ser Alton Lannister?
I am, Your Grace.
I offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms.
First, your family must release my sisters.
Second, my father’s bones must be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell.
And the remains of all those who died in his service must also be returned.
Their families can honour them with proper funerals.
An honourable request, Your Grace.
Third…
Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the North.
From this time till the end of time, we are a free and independent kingdom.
The King in the North.
King in the North.
King in the North.
Neither Joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again.
If he disregards this command, he shall suffer the same fate as my father, only I don’t need a servant to do my beheading for me.
These are…
Your Grace, these are…
These are my terms.
If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, I’ll give them peace.
If not, I will litter the South with Lannister dead.
King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace.
Oh, is he?
You’ll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton.
That will be all for tonight.
A word, Your Grace?
You don’t have to call me “Your Grace” when no one’s around.
It’s not so bad once you get used to it.
I’m glad someone’s gotten used to it.
The Lannisters are going to reject your terms, you know?
Of course they are.
We can fight them in the fields as long as you like, but we won’t beat them until you take King’s Landing.
And we can’t take King’s Landing without ships.
My father has ships and men who know how to sail them.
Men who fought my father.
Men who fought King Robert to free themselves from the yoke of the South, just like you’re doing now.
I’m his only living son.
He’ll listen to me.
I know he will.
I’m not a Stark.
I know that.
But your father raised me to be an honourable man.
We can avenge him together.
You don’t want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.
I need his ships.
They say he has .
They say a million rats live in the sewers of King’s Landing.
Shall we rally them to fight for us?
I understand you don’t trust Lord Greyjoy.
I don’t trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy.
Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion.
Yes.
And now I’m the one rebelling against the throne.
Before me, it was Father.
You married one rebel and mothered another.
I mothered more than just rebels, a fact you seem to have forgotten.
If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls, my bannermen will string me up by my feet.
You want to leave Sansa in the queen’s hands?
And Arya…
I haven’t heard a word about Arya.
What are we fighting for, if not for them?
It’s more complicated than that!
You know it is.
It’s time for me to go home.
I haven’t seen Bran or Rickon in months.
You can’t go to Winterfell.
I beg your pardon?
I’ll send Rodrik to watch over the boys because tomorrow you’ll ride south to the Stormlands.
Why in the name of all the gods…
Because I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon.
He’s rallied an army of ,.
You know him.
You know his family.
I haven’t seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy.
You have a hundred other lords…
Which of these lords do I trust more than you?
If Renly sides with us, we’ll outnumber them two to one.
When they feel the jaws beginning to shut, they’ll sue for peace.
We’ll get the girls back.
Then we’ll all go home, for good.
I will ride at first light.
We will all be together again soon, I promise.
You’ve done so well.
Your father would be proud.
Give Lord Renly my regards.
King Renly.
There’s a king in every corner now.
What is all this?
Returning this room to its proper appearance.
Say what you will about the Targaryens, they were conquerors.
That is a seat for a conqueror.
It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers.
We can’t find Arya Stark.
With luck, she’s dead in a ditch somewhere.
Perhaps.
But if not, we need her.
They’ll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone.
I think they might.
They’re weak.
They put too much value on their women.
We need to set our armies to the task of finding her.
Send out as many men as we can.
I’m sure if you asked Grandfather…
The king does not ask, he commands.
And my grandfather’s stupidity in the field of battle is the reason Robb Stark has Uncle Jaime in the first place.
His life is in danger.
We’re at war.
All our lives are in danger.
I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime.
And you.
Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne.
It’s not a claim.
The throne is mine.
Of course it is.
No one believes this foul gossip.
Someone believes it.
Father had other children?
Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?
What are you asking?
I’m asking if he fucked other women when he grew tired of you.
How many bastards does he have running…
What you just did is punishable by death.
You will never do it again.
Never.
That will be all, Mother.
No, no, no, no.
Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound?
Ease into it.
Slowly, with passion.
Oh, yeah.
Go wash yourselves.
Put some clothes on.
Both of you are working tonight.
We do things differently here, Daisy.
This isn’t some fivecopper bawdy house in Hayseed Hall.
Haystack Hall.
Wherever you’re from.
Our establishment doesn’t cater to ploughmen and goat herders.
Lord Olsen.
Taste is everything here.
Littlefinger’s a fancy man.
Don’t call him Littlefinger.
He doesn’t like it.
Lord Baelish.
She pretends she doesn’t speak the common tongue so that people will think she’s exotic.
She grew up just down the road in Flea Bottom.
She’s beautiful.
She’s a dumb slut, really, but a lid for every pot.
Lord Commander.
Good to see you again.
You do realise this establishment is owned by Lord Petyr Baelish, the King’s Master of Coin.
Coin which goes in many pockets.
Orders.
Whose orders?
Someone who doesn’t care what Littlefinger thinks.
No, you can’t.
No!
Please!
No!
Not my Barra!
Please.
Please.
Enough.
Get it done.
Kill the bastard.
No, no!
Please.
Give it here.
No, please.
Spread out.
Search every house.
Every room.
Look in every room.
Gendry!
His name is Gendry.
Where is the bastard?
The Night’s Watch!
Please, stop!
Where?
They took him up the Kingsroad, heading north.
How will we know him?
He’s got a bull’s head helmet.
He made it himself.
Find him.To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
Gotta be ready before nightfall.
Now keep it moving.
Put a watch on the ridgeand the tree lines.
Boy.
Lovely boy.
What do you want?
A man has a thirst.
A man does not drink for a day and a night.
A boy could make a friend.
I have friends.
Give us beer before I skin you.
A man does not choose his companions.
These two, they have no courtesy.
A man must ask forgiveness.
You’re called Arry?
This man has the honour to be Jaqen H’ghar,once of the Free City of Lorath…
Beer, you little shit.
Get us beer!
You should have asked nicely.
Aah!
Come closer…
and I’ll shove that stick up your bungholeand fuck you bloody.
That boy has more courage than sense.
Come here!
Yoren said none of us wereto go near those three.
Come here!
They don’t scare me.
Hmm?
Then you’re stupid.
They scare me.
What are gold cloaksdoing so far from King’s Landing?
What are you doing?
They’re looking for me.
You in command here?
You’re a long way from home.
I asked you a question.
Aye, you did.
You asked without mannersand I chose not to answer.
I have a royal warrantfor one of these gutter ratsyou’re transporting.
Well, the thing is…
these gutter rats belongto the Night’s Watch now.
That puts them beyond the reachof kings and queens.
Does it?
It’s a funny thing,people worry so much about their throatsthat they forget about what’s down low.
Now, I sharpened this blade before breakfast.
I could shave a spider’s arse if I wanted to.
Or…
I could nick this artery in your leg.
And once it’s nicked,there’s no one around herewho knows how to unnick it.
We’ll just keep that.
Good steel is always needed on the Wall.
Seems you have a choice,you can die here at this crossroadsa long way from home,or you can go back to your cityand tell your mastersyou didn’t find what you were looking for.
We’re looking for a boy named Gendry.
He carries a bull’s head helmet.
Anyone turning him overwill earn the King’s reward.
We’ll be back with more menand I’ll be taking your head homealong with that bastard boy.
My lord.
You make me wait a long time,but your friend keeps me company.
We were just speaking of your braveryin the victory againstthe Stark auxiliary forces.
It was quite a battle.
I heard you suffered a terrible head wound.
The northerners are such fearsome warriors.
And I tell him the story of how we meet.
To find so lovely a creatureworking in your father’s kitchens…
It almost beggars belief.
Strange things do happen.
You should taste her fish pie.
I don’t think Lord Varys likes fish pie.
How can you tell?
I can always tell.
Men like Lord Varys and I can’t letour disadvantages get the best of us.
We’ll make a fisherman of him yet.
I am glad your new friendwas able to accompany you to the capital.
Friends are such an important part of life.
Unfortunate that your fatherdidn’t want her to come.
But rest easy, my lord.
I am very good at keeping secretsfor my good friends.
Your discretion is legendary…
Where your friends are concerned.
How unspeakable of me to go on and onwhen all you want to do is rest.
I will leave you.
Welcome to King’s Landing, my dear.
This city is made brighter by your presence.
We have a council meeting, my lord.
I don’t like threats.
Who threatened you?
I’m not Ned Stark.
I understand the way this game is played.
Ned Stark was a man of honour.
And I am not.
Threaten me againand I’ll have you thrown into the sea.
You might be disappointed in the results.
Storms come and go,the big fish eat the little fish,and I keep on paddling.
Come, my lord.
We shouldn’t keep the queen waiting.
“From this time until the end of time,”we are not part of your realm,”but a free and independentKingdom of the North.
“He has more spirit than his father,I’ll give him that.
You’ve perfected the art of tearing up papers.
We can give him his father’s bones back,at least,as a gesture of good faith.
You’ll give the Starks our reply, cousin?
I will, Your Grace.
Did you see my brotherwhen you were the Starks’ guest?
I did.
They have not broken his spirit, Your Grace.
If you speak with him,tell him he’s not been forgotten.
I will, Your Grace.
Safe travels, cousin.
You have a deft hand with diplomacy.
If that’s everything…
A raven flew in this morningfrom Castle Black.
Trouble with the wildlings.
That’s why they’re called “wildlings.
“Somewhat less wild these days.
Seems they’ve stopped killing each otherand started followingthis kingbeyondtheWall.
Another king?
How many is that now?
Five?
I’ve lost count.
The Lord Commander asksthat we send more men to man the Wall.
Perhaps he’s forgotten we’re fighting a war.
We have no men to spare.
“The cold winds are risingand the dead rise with them.
“The northerners are a superstitious people.
According to the Commander,one of these dead menattacked him in his chambers.
Mormont doesn’t lie.
How do you kill a dead man?
Apparently you burn him.
One trip to the Wall and you come backbelieving in grumpkins and snarks.
I don’t know what I believe,but here’s a fact for youthe Night’s Watch is the only thingthat separates us fromwhat lies beyond the Wall.
I have every confidence that the brave menof the Night’s Watch will protect us all.
And I said,”If the gods wanted us to have dignity,”they wouldn’t make us fart when we died.
“We fart when we die?
My blessed mother,I was holding her handwhen she left this world.
She farted so hard, the whole bed shook.
Seems a bit greedy for one manto have so many wives.
Wouldn’t two or three be enough for him?
We were having a serious discussion.
Would you look at that?
Nothing like the sightof a woman walking away.
I prefer watching them come towards me.
I’m sure that’s nice, too.
Yeah, well, there was a milkmaid named Violeton the next farm over from where I grew up.
We were wrestling togetherfrom the time we were six years old.
And then we got older and the wrestling…
changed.
You were with her?
How many times?
Well, as many times as I could.
I wish I grew up on a farm.
We need more potatoes.
Get another sack from the sledge.
Get the turnips, too.
No.
Ghost, no.
No!
Ghost, away.
Shoo.
Shoo!
You all right?
Did he frighten you?
You shouldn’t touch me.
Oh.
Oh, right.
I’m sorry.
I just wanted to make sure you weren’t hurt.
You’re very brave.
What are you doing?
This is Gilly.
She’s one of Craster’s daughters.
Hello, Gilly.
What are you doing?
Sam said you could help.
I’m sorry, but Sam knowswe’re not supposed…
She’s pregnant.
We have to take her with us when we leave.
What?
What would that…
I know it sounds a bit mad.
No, it doesn’t sound a bit mad,it’s impossible.
The Lord Commander ordered us to…
We are sworn to protect.
Sam, we can’t take…
Please, sir, please.
I can still run if I have to.
It’s just not possible.
I’m going to have a baby.
If it’s a boy…
If it’s a boy, what?
You want us to risk our lives for youand you won’t even tell us why?
Why’d you do that?
Do what?
Ask her a question?
You were cruel.
Cruel?
Sam, are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?
I didn’t touch her.
No, you just want to steal her.
What do you think Craster cuts off for that?
I can’t steal her.
She’s a person, not a goat.
We’re headingdeeper and deeper into wildling territory.
We can’t take a girl with us.
Mormont wouldn’t have it.
And even if he would,what would we do with her?
Who’s going to deliver a baby, you?
I could try.
What?
I’ve read about it.
A bit.
I’m sorry, Sam.
We can’t help her.
Khaleesi.
You don’t need to see this.
He is blood of my blood.
Who did this?
Khal Pono, perhaps.
Khal Jhaqo.
They don’t like the idea of a womanleading a khalasar.
They will like it far lesswhen I am done with them.
They killed his soul!
Shh.
They cannot kill his soul.
They did!
They butchered him like an animal.
They did not burn his body.
He can never join his ancestorsin the night lands.
Shh.
We will build him a funeral pyre.
And I promise you,Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight.
Is it as you remember, my lord?
It looks smaller.
Everything looks bigger when you’re a child.
I remember my father’s cabinfelt like a palace when I was little.
Now look at it.
They’ll be waiting for me on the docks.
Who will?
Anyone who matters.
This is a big day for them.
They haven’t had much to getexcited about since I left.
It’s a hard place, the Iron Islands.
Always has been.
It’s cold and it’s wet.
Oh, I love the cold and wet.
They say hard places breed hard men.
And hard men rule the world.
Then you’ll be king before long.
Try smiling with your lips closed.
Better.
My father doesn’t trust you Iron Islanders.
I don’t blame him.
He says that you’re all reavers and rapersand that no matterhow many women you have,you’ll never be sat…
Quit talking about your father.
But he’s right about us.
Our wives from the Iron Islands,they’re for breeding.
That’s not enough for us.
That’s why we take salt wives,the women we capture.
Capture me.
Take me with you when you go ashore.
Make me your salt wife.
Your place is on this ship.
Not after you leave.
Father will punish me.
He’ll call me a whore.
I haven’t paid you.
Oh, yeah.
I paid good money…
I’m not going to stand for this.
I barely touched her.
Now, you charge twice as muchas every other brotheland this is what I get, crying.
One moment, my friend.
A moment.
Please accept my sincerest apologies.
Aremca will take good care of you.
I’m sorry, my lord.
Did he hurt you?
No, my lord.
It’s Mhaegen.
Who?
She works for you.
She’s the one…
The gold cloaks, they killed her baby.
Ah, yes.
That was…
poorly handled.
Sometimes those with the most powerhave the least grace.
I can’t stop thinking about it.
I can’t sleep.
Her poor little baby.
You know, you remind me of another girl,a lovely thing I once acquiredfrom a Lysene pleasure house.
Beautiful, like yourself,and intelligent, like yourself.
But she wasn’t happy.
She cried often.
I asked her why,but we didn’t have the kind of rapportthat you and I have.
Yes, it was quite sad.
Girls from the Lysene pleasure housesare expensive,extremely expensive.
And this one wasn’t making me any money.
I hate bad investments.
Really, I do.
They haunt me.
I had no idea how to make her happy,no idea how to mitigate my losses.
A very wealthy patron,he offered me a tremendous amount of moneyto let him transformthis lovely, sad girl.
To use her in waysthat would never occur to most men.
But you know what occurs to most men.
I would not say he succeededin making her happy,but my losses were definitely mitigated.
Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen’s child.
I’ll see you tomorrow.
And you’ll be happy?
That makes me happy.
More wine?
Damn it, boy!
Apologies, my lord.
Leave us, Podrick.
I believe we know how to pour our own wine.
That’s your new squire?
I could’ve found you a proper lad.
Myself, I prefer the improper ones.
That’s a good red.
Dornish?
You know your wines, my lord.
That I do.
A fine dinner, my lord.
Call me Tyrion, please.
I’m sure you’re getting used to fine dinners,now that you’re a lord.
Maybe I’ll hire this cook of yours.
Wars have been started for less.
I heard there was some troublein Littlefinger’s brothel the other night.
Mmm.
Nasty business.
Had to be done.
Yes, of course.
The City Watch must keep the peace.
Only, I hadn’t realisedpeace depended on killing babies.
Orders are orders.
Quite right.
Especially the Queen’s orders.
I never said they were the Queen’s orders.
No, but who else would wantto murder King Robert’s bastards?
She’s always been a jealous woman.
You know your sister better than I do.
You’ve heard the awful rumoursabout my brother and sister?
I don’t listen to filth.
That’s good of you, but you have heard them.
I suppose people who do believe that filthconsider Robert’s bastardsto be better claimants to the thronethan Cersei’s children.
Joffrey is my king.
The rest doesn’t interest me.
I appreciate your loyalty.
Tell me, when your menslaughtered Ned Stark’s menin the throne room, did you give the order?
I did.
And I would again.
The man was a traitor.
He tried to buy my loyalty.
The fool.
He had no idea you were already bought.
Are you drunk?
I’ll not have my honour questioned by an imp!
I’m not questioning your honour, Lord Janos.
I’m denying its existence.
If you think I’ll stand hereand take this from you, dwarf…
Dwarf?
You should have stopped at imp.
And, yes, you will stand hereand take it from me,unless you’d like to take itfrom my friend here.
I intend to serve as Hand of the Kinguntil my father returns from the war.
And seeing as you betrayedthe last Hand of the King,well, I just wouldn’t feel safewith you lurking about.
What are you…
My friends at court will not allow this!
The Queen herself has granted…
The Queen Regent.
And you’re a fool to believe she is your friend.
We shall hear what Joffreyhas to say about this.
No, we shan’t.
There’s a ship leavingfor EastwatchbytheSea tonight.
From there, I’m afraid,it’s rather a long walk to Castle Black.
I hope you enjoy the Wall.
I found it surprisingly beautiful…
in a brutal, horribly uncomfortablesort of way.
The lads will escort you.
The streets aren’t safe at night, my lord.
These men are under my command!
I command you to arrest this cutthroat.
His name is Bronn,and he is the new commanderof the City Watch.
Boys.
I have friends at court,powerful friends!
The king himself made me a lord!
To the new commander.
If I told you to murder an infant girl, say,still at her mother’s breast,would you do it without question?
Without question?
No.
I’d ask, “How much?
“If they come back, I say we yield.
Gendry’s the one they want.
Don’t want to get caughtin the middle of a battle.
I ain’t afraid of no battles.
If you got within a mile of a battle,you’d fill your pants.
I’ve seen lots of battles.
I saw…
Liar.
I saw a man kill another manjust outside a tavern in Flea Bottom.
Stabbed him right in the neck.
Two men fighting isn’t a battle.
They had armour on.
So?
So, if they’ve got armour on, it’s a battle.
No, it isn’t.
What does a dyer’s apprenticeknow about battles anyway?
Gendry’s an armourer’s apprentice.
Hot Pie, tell Gendrywhat makes a fight into a battle.
It’s when they’ve got armour on.
Who told you that?
A knight.
How’d you know he was a knight?
Well, it was ’cause he’d got armour on.
You don’t have to be a knight to have armour.
Any idiot can buy armour.
How do you know?
‘Cause I sold armour.
What do the gold cloaks want with you?
No idea.
You’re a liar.
You know, you shouldn’tinsult people that are bigger than you.
Then I wouldn’t get to insult anyone.
I don’t care what any of them want.
No good’s ever come of their questions.
No good’s ever come?
Who asked questions before?
How can someone so smallbe such a huge pain in my arse?
Who asked questions?
The Hand of the King.
Hands of the King.
Lord Arryn came firsta few weeks before he died,and then Lord Stark camea few weeks before he died.
Lord Stark?
See?
Asking me questions is bad luck.
You’ll probably be dead soon.
What did they ask about?
My mum.
Who’s your mum?
Just my mum,worked in a tavern, died when I was little.
And who was your father?
Could’ve been one of thosegoldhatted bastards, for all I know.
What about you anyway?
You thought they were after you.
Why?
Did you kill someoneor is it just because you’re a girl?
I’m not a girl.
Yes, you are.
Do you think I’m as stupidas the rest of them?
Stupider.
The Night’s Watch doesn’t take girls,everyone knows that.
Yeah, that’s true, but you’re still a girl.
I am not!
Yeah?
Well, pull your cock outand take a piss, then.
I don’t need to take a piss.
Lommy and Hot Pie can’t know.
No one can know.
Well, they won’t.
Not from me.
My name’s not Arry.
It’s Arya, of House Stark.
Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.
He was your father, the Hand, the traitor.
He was never a traitor.
Joffrey is a liar.
So you’re a highborn, then.
You’re a lady.
No.
I mean, yes.
My mother was a lady and my sister…
Yeah, but you were a lord’s daughter,and you lived in a castle and you…
Look, all that about cocks,I should never have said…
And I’ve been pissingin front of you and everything.
I should be calling you “my lady.
” Do not call me “my lady.
” As my lady commands.
Well, that was unladylike.
Oh!
What’s she carrying?
Myrish oranges,wine from the Arbor…
and the heir to Pyke and the Iron Islands.
The only living son of Balon Greyjoy.
Me.
I don’t like wine.
Woman’s drink.
I need to get to Pyke.
I’ll find you a horse.
I’m heading that way.
I can take you there.
I bet you can.
Have you been at sea long?
Or were there just no womenwhere you came from?
None like you.
You don’t know what I’m like.
Maybe you don’t know what you’re like.
Maybe you need someone to teach you.
Do you know who I am?
You think I offer free ridesto every man in jewellery,Lord Greyjoy?
Have my things sent up to the castle.
You should give me the reins.
I’m a better rider than you.
I’ve been on horsebackfor the past nine years.
Nine years?
Do you still know your way around a ship?
Have these hands ever touched a rope?
Don’t you worry about my hands.
The sea is in my blood.
Your blood will be in the seaif I don’t watch where I’m going.
I have a proposal for my father,one that will make him king again,and me after him.
You may get to stayin a castle tonight if you’re lucky.
Is that an offer from my future king?
An order from your future king.
You can tell your grandchildrenabout this night.
I don’t imagine it will bea story fit for children.
Father.
Nine years, is it?
They took a frightened boy.
What have they given back?
A man.
Your blood and your heir.
We shall see.
Stark had you longer than I did.
Lord Stark is gone.
And how do you feel about that?
What’s done is done.
I’ve brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.
Who gave you those clothes?
Was it Ned Stark’s pleasureto make you his daughter?
If my clothes offend you, I will change them.
You will.
That bauble round your neck,did you pay the iron price for it, or the gold?
I asked a question.
Did you pull it from the neckof a corpse you madeor did you buy it to match your fine clothes?
Iron or gold?
Gold.
I’ll not have my son dressed as a whore.
My fears have come true,the Starks have made you theirs.
My blood is salt and iron.
Yet the Stark boy sends you to melike a trained raven clutching his message.
The offer he makes is one I proposed.
He heeds your counsel?
I’ve lived with him,hunted with him, fought at his side.
He thinks of me as a brother.
No, not here, not in my hearing.
You will not name him brother,this son of the man who putyour true brothers to the sword.
Or have you forgotten your own blood?
I forget nothing.
I remember my brothers.
And I remember when my father was a king.
I see.
I destroy Robb Stark’s enemies for himand he will make meking of the Iron Islands once again.
I will lead the attack myself.
Oh, you will?
I’m your son, your only living heir.
Who else?
I told you to wait outside.
How did you get past the guards?
Anything with a cock is easy to fool.
My dear.
Yara?
So good to see you, brother.
This is a homecomingI’ll tell my grandchildren about.
She can’t lead an attack!
And why not?
You’re a woman!
You’re the one in skirts.
This isn’t Winterfell, boy.
Your sister took over commandof your eldest brother’s shipafter your new father killed him.
What’s dead may never die…
.
dead may never die.
The only nights she’s spent off these islandshave been spent on the sea.
She’s commanded men.
She’s killed men.
She knows who she is.
No man gives me a crown.
I pay the iron price.
I will take my crown,for that is who I am.
That is who we have always been.
You won’t stand a chanceagainst the Lannisters on your own.
Who said anything about the Lannisters?
You’ll have your goldwhen we take the treasury at King’s Landing.
All these kings fighting for the throne,and this Stannis has the smallest army.
Why would I bet on the manwith the worst chance?
Because you’re a smart gambler.
Stannis has proved himself in war twice.
His baby brother has never set footon a battlefield.
Neither has the false King Joffrey.
And yet they both have larger armies.
Stannis has just begun the fight.
His bannermen will rally to his cause.
There’s no man in the Seven Kingdomsmore honourable than Stannis Baratheonor more worthy of loyalty.
What is the world coming towhen smugglers must vouchfor the honour of kings?
Mind your words, pirate.
Matthos.
You think I’m insulted?
I am a pirate.
I’m an excellent pirate.
I don’t sail for promises.
Of course you do.
Every time you leave harbour,you’re leaving on a promise,a promise that somewhere on the sea,somebody’s got some goldand you can take it from him.
That’s a promise that always comes true.
As is mine.
You’re not a young man, Salladhor.
And correct me if I’m wrong,most pirates don’t grow old.
Only the clever ones.
You want to spendyour last few years on the seastealing from Pentoshi cheesemongersand Myrenese silk merchants, then go.
They’re out there waiting for you.
That’s easy.
What I’m offering you is hard.
Come with me and plunderthe greatest city in Westeros.
You’ll be the richest man in Lys,and the most famous.
They’ll be singing songs about youas long as men have voices to sing.
“Salladhor Saan” is a good name for songs.
It is.
One thing, I want the queen.
The queen?
Cersei, I want her.
I’ll sail with your fleet, allof my ships.
And if we don’t drown at the bottomof Blackwater Bay,I will fuck this blonde queenand I’ll fuck her well.
This war isn’t about you.
We’re not attacking King’s Landingso that you can rape the queen.
I’m not going to rape her.
I’m going to fuck her.
As if she would just let you.
You don’t know how persuasive I am.
I’ve never tried to fuck you.
Stannis is the rightful kingand the Lord of Light,the one true god…
I’ve been all over the world, my boy,and everywhere I go,people tell me about the true gods.
They all think they found the right one.
The one true godis what’s between a woman’s legs,and better yet, a queen’s legs.
I never thought you’d havea true believer for a son.
He’s young yet.
I promise you the gold.
I promise you the glory.
I cannot promise you the queen.
You believe your king can win?
He is the one true king.
You Westerosi are funny people.
A man chops off your fingersand you fall in love with him.
I’ll sail with you, Davos Seaworth.
You’re the most honest smuggler I ever met.
Make me rich.
Get me to the gatesof King’s Landing and I will.
When will the king have us sail?
As soon as his god wills it.
He’s my god, too, and yours,but you are too blind to see.
Let me teach you how to read.
Oh, you and your mother.
It won’t take long.
You already know the letters.
The holy books aremuch more persuasive than I can be.
I wish I had a god, truly.
I’m not mocking you,but I’ve seen men pray to every god there is,pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home.
None of it works.
But you always came home.
I wasn’t praying.
But I was.
Every night that you were at sea,I lit a candle and I prayed for you.
You want me to have a god?
Fine.
King Stannis is my god.
He raised me upand blessed me with his trust.
He gave you a futureI could never have imagined.
You know how to read.
You’ll be a knight someday.
You think a fire god commanded all that?
It was Stannis, only Stannis.
Stannis is my king, but he’s only a man.
Don’t tell him that.
Lord Janos Slyntwas commander of the City Watch.
You had no right to exile him.
I have every right.
I am the King’s Hand.
You’re serving as the King’s Handtill Father gets here.
I am Queen Regent.
Listen to me, Queen Regent.
You’re losing the people.
Do you hear me?
The people.
You think I care?
You might find it difficultto rule over millions who want you dead.
Half the city will starve when winter comes.
The other half will plot to overthrow you.
And your goldplated thugsjust gave them their rallying cry,”The Queen slaughters babies.
“You don’t even have the decency to deny it.
It wasn’t you who gave the order, was it?
Joffrey didn’t even tell you.
Did he tell you?
I imagine that would be even worse.
He did what needed to be done.
You want to be Hand of the King?
You want to rule?
This is what ruling is,lying on a bed of weeds,ripping them out by the root, one by one,before they strangle you in your sleep.
I’m no king,but I think there’s more to ruling than that.
I don’t care what you think!
You’ve never taken it seriously.
You haven’t, Jaime hasn’t.
It’s all fallen on me.
As has Jaime, repeatedly,according to Stannis Baratheon.
You’re funny.
You’ve always been funny…
but none of your jokes will ever matchthe first one, will they?
You remember?
Back when you ripped my mother openon your way out of herand she bled to death?
She was my mother, too.
Mother gone…
for the sake of you.
There’s no bigger joke in the world than that.
Your Grace.
Your Grace.
How did you fare with your pirate?
Salladhor Saan will join our fleet,ships.
His men know how to fight.
In my experience,pirates prefer fighting unarmed men.
It does seem the wiser choice.
There won’t be a choice this time.
Do you trust him?
Salladhor Saan is an old friend.
I’ve known himyears.
I’ve never trusted him.
Now, once he gets the smell of goldhe never stops.
Well, if he does his job, he’ll have his share.
Leave us.
At once, Your Grace.
The Lord of Light shines through you,young warrior.
Come.
What did you say to him?
I told him death by fire is the purest death.
Why?
Because it is true.
You’re troubled, my king.
Yeah.
These armies are toys for the Lord of Light.
Tell your lord to burn them, then.
I tell him nothing.
I pray for his commands and I obey.
My little brother has , men,according to the scouts,men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.
You must have faith.
Faith?
In a real war, the side withthe greater number wins,nine times out of ten.
Then we must be the th.
I cannot defeat my brother in the field.
And I can’t take King’s Landingwithout the men he’s stolen.
I have seen the path to victory in the flames.
But first, you must give yourselfto the Lord of Light.
I’ve said the words, damn you.
I burned the idols.
You must give all of yourself.
I have a wife.
I took a vow.
She’s sickly, weak…
Shut away in a tower.
She disgusts you.
And she’s given you nothing,no sons, only stillborns,only death.
I will give you a son, my king.
A son?To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
Out, all of you.
This bastard’s been meddling where he shouldn’t!
I want you and your men gone.
And you will make this right.
Wait outside.
Lord Commander…
Now!
Lord Commander…
Leave us.
What did you do?
I followed him.
He took the baby into the woods, the newborn.
What business is that of yours?
No, you don’t understand.
He’s killing them, all the boys.
You know.
Wildlings serve crueller gods than you or I.
Those boys are Craster’s offerings.
Offerings?
He’s murdering his own children.
He’s a monster.
Aye, many a time that monster has been the difference between life and death for our rangers, your uncle among them.
We have other wars to fight out there.
Like it or not, we need men like Craster.
I…
I saw it.
I saw something take that child.
Yeah.
Whatever it was, I daresay you’ll see it again.
Now, ready my horse.
We leave at dawn.
Don’t lose it again.
Gilly.
You’re leaving.
I…
I wanted to give you something.
It belonged to my mother.
I can’t take it.
Please.
I want you to.
My mother used it for sewing.
She’d let me sit with her in her chamber while she sewed and I’d read to her.
My father put a stop to it when he found out.
It’s the only thing I have of hers.
She gave it to me before I left for the Wall.
You…
You shouldn’t give it away.
I’m not giving it away.
I’m giving it to you.
Keep it safe for me.
Till I come back.
Hodor.
Hodor.
Rouse Bran, will you?
It’s time for his lessons.
Every night it’s the same.
I’m walking and running, but…
I’m not…
I’m not me.
I’m running through the godswood, sniffing the dirt, tasting blood in my mouth when I’ve made a fresh kill, howling.
Old Nan used to tell me stories about magical people who could live inside stags, birds, wolves.
That’s exactly what they are, Bran, stories.
So she was lying?
They don’t exist?
Well, they may have done.
But they’re gone from the world, along with much else.
These are dreams, Bran, nothing more.
No, my dreams are different.
Mine are true.
I dreamt of my father dying.
And Rickon had the same dream.
What about all the dreams you had that didn’t come true?
Hmm?
Right.
This link is made of Valyrian steel.
Only one maester in wears it on his chain.
It signifies that I have studied the higher mysteries.
And all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells.
I was no different.
I was young.
And what boy doesn’t secretly wish for hidden powers to lift him out of his dull life into a special one?
But in the end, for all my efforts, I got no more out of it than a thousand boys before me.
Come on.
All right.
Maybe magic once was a mighty force in the world.
But not any more.
The dragons are gone.
The giants are dead.
And the Children of the Forest forgotten.
Loras!
Highgarden!
Get him!
Oh!
Yield!
I yield.
Well fought.
Approach.
Rise.
Remove your helm.
You are all your father promised and more, my lady.
I’ve seen Ser Loras bested once or twice, but never quite in that fashion.
Now, now, my love.
My brother fought valiantly for you.
That he did, my queen.
But there can only be one champion.
Brienne of Tarth, you may ask anything of me you desire.
If it is within my power, it is yours.
Your Grace, I ask the honour of a place in your Kingsguard.
What?
I will be one of your seven, pledge my life to yours, and keep you safe from all harm.
Done.
Rise, Brienne of the Kingsguard.
Your Grace, I have the honour to bring you Lady Catelyn Stark, sent as an envoy by her son Robb, Lord of Winterfell.
Lord of Winterfell and King in the North.
Lady Catelyn.
I’m pleased to see you.
May I present my wife, Margaery of House Tyrell?
You are very welcome here, Lady Stark.
I’m so sorry for your loss.
You are most kind.
My lady, I swear to you I will see the Lannisters answer for your husband’s murder.
When I take King’s Landing, I’ll bring you Joffrey’s head.
It will be enough to know that justice was done, my lord.
Your Grace.
And you should kneel when you approach the king.
There’s no need for that.
Lady Stark is an honoured guest.
Has your son marched against Tywin Lannister yet?
I do not sit on my son’s war councils.
And if I did, I would not share his strategies with you.
If Robb Stark wants a pact with us, he should come himself, not hide behind his mother’s skirts.
My son is fighting a war, not playing at one.
Don’t worry, my lady.
Our war is just beginning.
Your Grace.
Gerard.
How’s your foot?
Better, Your Grace.
They don’t know their own size is all.
Good man.
I have , men at my command.
All the might of the Stormlands and the Reach.
And all of them young and bold like your Knight of Flowers?
It’s a game to you, isn’t it?
I pity them.
Why?
Because it won’t last.
Because they are the knights of summer and winter is coming.
Brienne, escort Lady Catelyn to her tent.
She’s tired from her journey.
At once, Your Grace.
Shall I return after?
That won’t be necessary.
I would pray awhile.
Alone.
If you’ll follow me, my lady.
You fought bravely today, Lady Brienne.
I fought for my king.
Soon I’ll fight for him on the battlefield.
Die for him if I must.
And, if it please you, Brienne’s enough.
I’m no lady.
What are you doing here?
I live here.
Are you angry with me, brother?
You lying bitch.
It’s not my fault you didn’t recognise me.
Recognise you?
How could I?
The last time I saw you…
you looked like a fat little boy.
You were a fat little boy, too, but I recognised you.
Why didn’t you tell me?
I wanted to see who you were first.
And I did.
The plans are made.
It’s time you heard them.
Father.
Father.
The wolf pup has gone south with the entirety of the Northern army at his back.
While he’s tangling with the lion in the Westerlands, the North is ripe for the taking.
The ironborn will reave and pillage, as it was in the old days, all along the northern coast.
We’ll spread our dominion across the green lands, securing the Neck and everything above.
Every stronghold will yield to us, one by one.
Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of it?
The rest shall be ours, forest, field, and hall.
Yara, my daughter, you’ll take longships to attack Deepwood Motte.
I’ve always wanted a castle.
And what’s my role in all this?
You’ll take a ship to raid the fishing villages on the Stoney Shore.
A ship?
You give her and I get one?
The Sea Bitch.
We thought she’d be perfect for you.
I’m to fight fishermen?
Be careful of their nets.
Father, I fought with Robb Stark.
I know his men.
He won’t give up the North so easily.
They won’t even know we’re there until it’s too late.
What do you know of it, woman?
I’m a proven warrior.
Your brothers were warriors, both of them dead at the hands of those you seem so eager to protect.
I’m not protecting anyone.
I just wonder if it’s not wiser to wait.
Why risk going against the North if they would be our allies?
Rise up against them and they could destroy us.
But if we pledge fealty to them, they’ll give us Casterly Rock.
What are our words?
Our words?
We do not sow.
We do not sow.
We are ironborn.
We’re not subjects.
We’re not slaves.
We do not plough the fields or toil in the mine.
We take what is ours.
Your time with the wolves has made you weak.
You act as if I volunteered to go.
You gave me away, if you remember.
The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon.
After he crushed you.
Did you take what was yours then?
You gave me away!
Your boy!
Your last boy!
You gave me away like I was some dog you didn’t want any more.
And now you curse me because I’ve come home.
You’d have our father bow down to your other family?
I have no other family.
Don’t you?
Make your choice, Theon, and do it quickly.
Our ships sail with or without you.
You won’t let me leave this room.
You won’t let me…
Keep your voice down.
Why?
You think your father can hear me?
He’s miles away!
I don’t intend for you to stay here.
I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens.
Again, only temporary.
Every man who has tasted my cooking has told me what a good whore I am.
But you wouldn’t be a cook.
You’d pose as a scullion.
Scullion?
What is a scullion?
Kitchen wench.
A kitchen wench?
Yes, but…
Cleaning pots?
Is that how my lion wants to see me?
Your lion wants to see you alive.
We’ve come to a dangerous place.
My sister wants to hurt me.
She’ll look for any weakness she can find.
She can’t know about you.
I’m the weakness?
It’s a compliment, my lady.
How is being a weakness a compliment?
Language can be a bit tricky here.
Oh.
I’m too stupid to understand.
The stupid foreign girl.
I am not a kitchen wench.
When will Joffrey and Sansa be married?
Soon, darling, when the war is over.
Mother says I’ll have a new gown for the ceremony and another for the feast.
But yours will be ivory, since you’re the bride.
The Princess just spoke to you.
Pardon, Your Grace.
I’m sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella.
I’m counting the days until the fighting is done and I can pledge my love to the king in sight of the gods.
Is Joffrey going to kill Sansa’s brother?
He might.
Would you like that?
No.
I don’t think so.
Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty.
Won’t you, little dove?
Come in.
Who are you?
I’m Shae, My Lady.
Your new handmaiden.
I didn’t know I needed a new handmaiden.
You’re not from here.
No.
What are you doing?
Waiting for you to tell me what to do.
I shouldn’t have to tell you to do things.
You should just do them.
What things?
Change my linens, wash my clothing, scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot, brush my hair.
No.
You said to brush…
Not now.
Your chamber pot is empty.
Clean the table.
Have you ever been a handmaiden before?
Yes.
For whom?
Lady Zuriff.
Lady Zuriff?
Lady Zuriff.
There is no Lady Zuriff in this city.
She wasn’t in this city.
I don’t know how they did things in that city, but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies, not the other way around.
And I don’t have time to answer a thousand questions and teach you how to do your job.
Do you want me to leave?
Just brush my hair.
Oh!
Thank the gods.
I haven’t had a proper shit in six days.
I’ve encountered this problem before, my lord.
The stresses of power often have this insalubrious effect.
Two drops with water, daily.
Right.
I’m so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side.
Please.
Thank you, my lord.
I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?
Why, yes, of course, my lord.
These are perilous times.
And the crown must forge new alliances.
And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.
Matrimony, huh?
Yes.
I’m trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen mustn’t know.
We can’t have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm.
There’s too much at stake.
Oh, yes, yes.
Indeed, yes.
I shall be silent as the grave.
I’m brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne.
Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age, ensuring their loyalty and their army, should we need it.
Myrcella sent away to Dorne?
But remember, the Queen mustn’t know.
Ooh.
“The Queen mustn’t know.
” I love conversations that begin this way.
I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy.
Theon Greyjoy?
Forgive me, my lord, but how?
He grew up a ward of Winterfell.
He fights for Robb Stark.
Precisely.
Theon’s father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side.
Greyjoy can destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his father’s ships.
But remember, you must tell no one.
Tell no one what?
I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale.
Lysa is not fond of me.
But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones.
She imprisoned you.
She tried to execute you.
And you offer her son a princess?
For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don’t you think?
And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?
Who better?
Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to.
What’s in it for me?
The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the king for bringing the Vale back into the fold…
and Harrenhal.
Harrenhal is cursed.
Never took you for a superstitious man.
By all means, tear it down and rebuild.
You’ll be able to afford it.
I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands.
With a single stroke, you’d make me one of the greatest lords in the realm.
You served my family well in the matter of the succession.
So did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too.
Until you snatched it away.
I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn.
I didn’t need Janos Slynt.
It’s settled, then?
Good.
Oh.
And remember…
The Queen mustn’t know.
That must hurt.
What?
What is it?
A member of the Kingsguard?
As if I wasn’t humiliated enough already.
Brienne is a very capable warrior.
And she’s devoted to me.
You’re jealous.
Jealous?
Of Brienne the Beauty?
Don’t make me laugh.
I’ll make it up to you.
No, Your Grace.
Not tonight.
There’s another Tyrell who requires your attention.
You didn’t win my father’s support or his army on charm alone.
Your vassals are starting to snigger behind your back.
Brides aren’t usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night.
And Margaery’s a virgin?
Officially.
Shall I bring her to you?
I should warn you, I’ve had quite a bit of wine.
As is your right.
You are a king.
You look very beautiful.
Thank you, Your Grace.
It’s a lovely gown.
You think so?
I can’t decide how I like it better.
This way, or this way.
You certainly don’t need it.
Although, some say the beauty most desired is the beauty concealed.
Must be the wine.
Here, let me.
I’m sorry.
Do you want my brother to come in and help?
What?
He could get you started.
I know he wouldn’t mind.
Or I can turn over and you can pretend I’m him.
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
There’s no need for us to play games.
Save your lies for court.
You’re going to need a lot of them.
Your enemies aren’t happy about us.
They want to tear us apart.
And the best way to stop them is to put your baby in my belly.
We can try again later.
You decide how you want to do it, with me, with me and Loras, however else you like.
Whatever you need to do.
You are a king.
You monster.
Myrcella is my only daughter.
Do you really think I’ll let you sell her like a common whore?
Myrcella’s a princess.
Some would say she was born for this.
I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.
Dorne is the safest place for her.
Are you mad?
The Martells loathe us.
That’s why we need to seduce them.
We’re going to need their support in the war your son started.
She’ll be a hostage.
A guest.
You won’t get away with this.
You think the piece of paper Father gave you keeps you safe.
Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too.
It’s done, Cersei.
No.
You cannot stop it.
No!
Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls?
Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children?
Make no mistake.
They’ll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours.
Get out!
Get out!
Theon of the House Greyjoy, you would this day consecrate your faith to the Drowned God?
I would.
Kneel.
Let Theon, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were.
Bless him with salt.
Bless him with stone.
Bless him with steel.
What is dead may never die.
What is dead may never die.
But rises again harder and stronger.
Stand.
I don’t appreciate being made a fool of, dwarf.
If Myrcella marries the Martell boy, she can’t very well marry Robin Arryn, can she?
No, afraid not.
Sorry about that.
And Harrenhal, I suppose that’s off the table as well.
Yes, I fear so.
Sorry about that, too.
Leave me out of your next deception.
That’s a shame.
You were to be the centrepiece of my next deception.
My brother Jaime rots in a northern stockade.
I would see him released.
That’s where you come in.
Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.
No, he won’t.
But his mother might.
How would you like to see your beloved Cat again?
Find him?
Oh, aye.
And he has company.
Filthy old stoat.
Almost hate to interrupt.
No, you don’t.
No, I don’t.
What is the meaning of this?
No, please, please.
You disappoint me, Grand Maester.
I am your loyal servant.
So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne.
No!
Never!
It’s a falsehood.
I swear it.
It wasn’t me.
Ah, Varys.
It was Varys the Spider.
See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys.
I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn.
I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish.
No one but you.
The eunuch has spies everywhere.
Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.
No, no, no.
There are no goats, halfman.
Well, make do.
How long have you been spying for my sister?
All I did, I did for House Lannister.
Always.
Your lord father, ask him.
I’ve always been his servant since the days of the Mad King.
I don’t like his beard.
What?
What?
No.
No.
How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle?
Eddard Stark?
Jon Arryn?
Lord Arryn, he knew.
He knew the truth about the Queen.
And…
he planned to act, to tell King Robert.
So you poisoned him?
No.
Never.
But you let him die, made sure he succumbed.
Lannister…
I always served Lannister.
Get him out of my sight.
Throw him in one of the black cells.
No.
No, no, no.
No, please.
Don’t!
You can’t do this to me!
For your trouble.
You’ll be pleased to know our mutual friend is doing quite well in Lady Sansa’s service.
Good.
One of my better ideas.
And it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell?
Well played, My Lord Hand.
But should I be worried?
Janos Slynt, Pycelle…
The Small Council grows smaller every day.
The Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly.
I don’t mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.
Power is a curious thing, my lord.
Are you fond of riddles?
Why, am I about to hear one?
Three great men sit in a room.
A king, a priest and a rich man.
Between them stands a common sellsword.
Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two.
Who lives, who dies?
Depends on the sellsword.
Does it?
He has neither crown nor gold nor favour with the gods.
He has a sword, the power of life and death.
But if it’s swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power?
When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible?
Joffrey?
The executioner?
Or something else?
I’ve decided I don’t like riddles.
Power resides where men believe it resides.
It’s a trick, a shadow on the wall.
And a very small man can cast a very large shadow.
You should be sleeping.
Tomorrow’s a long march.
Thirty miles, if it don’t piss on us.
I can’t sleep.
I don’t like the taste.
You don’t drink it for the flavour, to be honest.
What?
How do you sleep?
Same as most men, I think.
But you’ve seen things, horrible things.
Aye.
I’ve seen some pretty things, too, but not nearly so many.
How do you sleep when you…
When you have those things in your head?
You didn’t see that.
I made damn sure.
I close my eyes and I see them up there.
All of them standing there.
Joffrey, the Queen and…
and my sister.
You know, we’ve got something in common, me and you.
You know that?
I must have been a couple of years older than you.
I saw my brother stabbed through the heart right on our doorstep.
He weren’t much of a villain what skewered him.
Willem, the lad’s name was.
He ran off before anyone could spit.
And I just stood there, watching my brother die.
Here’s the funny part.
I can’t picture my brother’s face any more.
But Willem, oh, he was a nicelooking boy.
He had good white teeth, blue eyes, one of those dimpled chins all the girls like.
I would think about him when I was working, when I was drinking, when I was having a shit.
It got to the point where I would say his name every night before I went to bed.
Willem.
Willem.
Willem.
A prayer almost.
Well, one day, Willem came riding back into town.
I buried an axe so deep into Willem’s skull they had to bury him with it.
Willem’s horse got me to the Wall and I’ve been wearing black ever since.
That’ll help you sleep, eh?
Ho!
Get up, you lazy sons of whores!
Arm yourselves.
Get up.
Get up.
Keep out of sight, both of you.
No, I’m not afraid.
I can fight.
Keep out of sight.
If things go wrong, you run.
Do you hear me?
You run along north and don’t look back.
Hey, there’s men out there who want to fuck your corpses.
Outside, now!
Come on, move, move!
Gold cloaks!
Everyone out!
Hey, you!
Open the damn cage!
Where’s the bastard, crow?
Got more than a few bastards here.
Who’s asking?
Ser Amory Lorch, sworn bannerman to Lord Tywin Lannister.
These men from the capital requested our assistance.
Drop your weapons in the name of the king.
Now, which king would that be?
This is your last chance.
In the name of King Joffrey, drop your weapons.
I don’t think I will.
So be it.
I always hated crossbows.
Take too long to load.
Boy, come here.
Boy!
Sweet boy, help us.
Come back here!
Help us, boy!
A man can fight!
Free us!
Quick, give it to me.
Give me the axe.
Give me that.
Put them on the wagon!
There’s more here.
Come on.
What do we have here?
No!
That’s a fine little blade.
Maybe I’ll pick my teeth with it.
I yield!
I yield!
Round up any survivors.
We’ll take them back to Harrenhal.
You heard him.
You’re coming with us.
I yield!
Help!
Help me!
Something wrong with your leg, boy?
Look at it.
Can you walk?
No.
You got to carry me.
All right.
“Carry him,” he says.
We’re looking for a bastard named Gendry.
Give him up or I’ll start taking eyeballs.
You want Gendry?
You already got him.
He loved that helmet.To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
It’s got to be the Mountain.
He’s the biggest.
He’s the strongest.
Bulls are bigger than lions.
Doesn’t mean I’d pick a bull in a fight.
If the bull had fangs and claws, I would.
Right, the Mountain or our man Jaime.
If he ever gets out.
Loras Tyrell?
Loras Tyrell.
He’s prettier than the queen.
I don’t care about pretty.
He’s better with a sword than any of them.
How good could he be?
He’s been stabbing Renly Baratheon for years, and Renly ain’t dead.
The horses seem a little spooked to you?
They’re horses.
They get spooked by their own shadows.
Do you hear that?
No.
There’s something out there.
Oh.
Oh, you’re a right little prick.
You should see your face.
I swear you pissed yourself.
“Oh, who goes there?
Ahh!” There is something out there.
Yeah, don’t even try me.
Rennick.
Do you think I’m an idiot?
Rennick! King in the North! The King in the North! Five Lannisters dead for every one of ours.
They’re dead.
Take everything they’ve got.
We’ve nowhere to keep all these prisoners.
Barely enough food to feed our own.
We’re not executing prisoners, Lord Bolton.
Of course, Your Grace.
The officers will be useful.
Some of them may be privy to Tywin Lannister’s plans.
I doubt it.
Well, we’ll learn soon enough.
In my family, we say, “A naked man has few secrets.
“A flayed man none.
” My father outlawed flaying in the North.
We’re not in the North.
We’re not torturing them.
The high road’s very pretty, but you’ll have a hard time marching your army down it.
The Lannisters hold prisoners of their own.
I won’t give them an excuse to abuse my sisters.
No, don’t! Don’t! Please! The rot’s set in.
No, don’t! No, don’t! Shh.
Please, don’t! It’ll get better.
It doesn’t even hurt.
The rot will spread.
If we don’t take the foot now…
No, you can’t! Ser! Please, ser.
I can’t lose…
You’ll die if she doesn’t.
I don’t want to be a cripple, please.
Surely one of our men needs your attention more than this cub.
Your men are not my men, my lord.
Put this in your mouth and lie down.
You don’t want to watch.
No! You can’t! Bite on it.
It’s better than biting your own tongue, believe me.
What’s your name?
Talisa.
Your last name?
You want to know what side my family fights on?
You know my family name.
You have me at a disadvantage.
That boy lost his foot on your orders.
They killed my father.
That boy did?
The family he fights for.
Do you think he’s friends with King Joffrey?
He’s a fisherman’s son that grew up near Lannisport.
He probably never held a spear before they shoved one in his hands a few months ago.
I have no hatred for the lad.
That should help his foot grow back.
You’d have us surrender, end all this bloodshed.
I understand.
The country would be at peace and life would be just under the righteous hand of good King Joffrey.
You’re going to kill Joffrey?
If the gods give me strength.
And then what?
I don’t know.
We’ll go back to Winterfell.
I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne.
So who will?
I don’t know.
You’re fighting to overthrow a king, and yet you have no plan for what comes after?
First we have to win the war.
You never told me where you’re from.
Volantis.
Volantis?
You’re far from home.
The boy was lucky you were here.
He was unlucky that you were.
You’re here to answer for your brother’s latest treasons.
Your Grace, whatever my traitor brother has done, I had no part.
You know that.
I beg you, please…
Ser Lancel, tell her of this outrage.
Using some vile sorcery, your brother fell on Stafford Lannister with an army of wolves.
Thousands of good men were butchered.
After the slaughter, the Northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain.
Killing you would send your brother a message.
But my mother insists on keeping you alive.
Stand.
So we’ll have to send your brother a message some other way.
Meryn.
Leave her face.
I like her pretty.
Meryn, my lady is overdressed.
Unburden her.
If you want Robb Stark to hear us, we’re going to have to speak louder.
What is the meaning of this?
What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?
The kind who serves his king, Imp.
Careful, now.
We don’t want to get blood all over your pretty white cloak.
Someone get the girl something to cover herself with.
She is to be your queen.
Have you no regard for her honour?
I’m punishing her.
For what crimes?
She did not fight her brother’s battle, you halfwit.
You can’t talk to me like that.
The king can do as he likes! The Mad King did as he liked.
Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him?
No one threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard.
I’m not threatening the king, ser.
I am educating my nephew.
Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him.
That was a threat.
See the difference?
I apologise for my nephew’s behaviour.
Tell me the truth.
Do you want an end to this engagement?
I am loyal to King Joffrey, my one true love.
Lady Stark, you may survive us yet.
The little king’s backed up.
Clogged from balls to brains.
You think dipping his wick will cure what ails him?
There’s no cure for being a cunt.
But the boy’s at that age.
And he’s got nothing to do all day but pick wings off flies.
Couldn’t hurt to get some of the poison out.
What are you doing here, dog?
Your uncle left your nameday present and asked me to see that you got it.
And?
What is it?
Look inside, Your Grace.
Your Grace.
Happy nameday, Your Grace.
My nameday has passed.
We won’t tell if you won’t.
No.
Her.
Touch her.
Could you hit her?
My uncle sent you?
Yes, Your Grace.
He chose us himself.
Hmm.
Use this.
Harder.
I said harder.
He’d want me to get his money’s worth.
Your Grace, too much pain will spoil the pleasure.
Please, Your Grace.
Your Grace, if your uncle finds out…
Oh, I want him to find out.
You will bring her to his chambers when you’re finished and show him what you’ve done, or the same thing will happen to you.
Begin.
Harder! Well, if it isn’t my favourite whoremonger.
Pray I haven’t kept you waiting long.
Your Grace.
Now you do the Lannisters’ bidding, is that it?
Tell me, was my brother’s body even cold before you secured your newest patron?
I’m a practical man.
Just not a loyal one.
And who would you have me be loyal to?
Your brother’s corpse?
I don’t like you, Lord Baelish.
I don’t like your face.
I don’t like the words that come oozing out of your mouth.
I don’t want you in my tent one minute more than necessary.
So tell me, why are you here?
You can trust Brienne.
Her loyalty comes without charge.
You still have many friends at court, Your Grace, many who believe Ned Stark erred by not supporting your claim.
Now I understand.
You know I have the numbers.
You know I’m marching on King’s Landing.
When I take the throne, you hope to retain your position.
And your head.
I would give priority to my head.
I understand that you don’t like me, and while that saddens me greatly, I did not come here today seeking your affection.
When you march on King’s Landing, you may find yourself facing a protracted siege or…
open gates.
Your Grace.
Lord Baelish.
All of these tents look the same to me.
Would you be so kind…
It would be my pleasure.
It took me weeks to learn my way around the camp.
Twice I walked in on officers in stages of undress.
And the moment I learn which tent is mine, we’re on the move again.
“Your tent”?
Not “Our tent”?
The king snores, perhaps?
Or simply prefers solitude?
Pressures of command, no doubt.
Four kings vying for the throne.
I am not tutored in warfare, but basic arithmetic favours the side with the greater numbers.
If war were arithmetic, the mathematicians would rule the world.
I did notice your brother entering His Grace’s tent just now.
The place of a Kingsguard is by the king’s side.
And on the night of your wedding, who was by the king’s side then?
You seem quite interested in our marriage.
Your marriage is quite interesting.
Not only to me, but to the realm.
The marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest, if nothing else.
You’ve never married, have you?
I’ve been unlucky in my affections, sadly.
That is sad.
Though perhaps it’s for the best.
The whole notion of marriage seems to confuse you, so allow me to explain.
My husband is my king, and my king is my husband.
Here is your tent, Lord Baelish.
Good night.
This isn’t your horse.
It was given to me by the Thirteen.
The Elders of Qarth.
Qarth?
Three days to the east, on the sea.
Will they let us in?
They said they would be honoured to receive the Mother of Dragons.
What do you know of this place?
Only that the desert around their walls is called the Garden of Bones.
Every time the Qartheen shut their gates on a traveller, the garden grows.
Go on! You, keep moving! Bring her about! What kind of fire melts stone?
Dragon fire.
There’s dragons here?
No, all the dragons are dead.
What’s that smell?
Dead people.
Move.
Please, please, no, no! No.
He’s dead.
He was my son.
My sister was three days ago.
My husband, the day before that.
They take someone every day?
Does anyone live?
Joffrey.
Cersei.
Ilyn Payne.
The Hound.
Joffrey.
Cersei.
Ilyn Payne.
The Hound.
Joffrey.
Cersei.
Ilyn Payne.
The Hound.
How dare you?
You may have heard false reports.
You betrayed Ned.
Betrayed?
I wanted him to serve as Protector of the Realm.
I begged him to seize the moment.
I trusted you.
My husband trusted you.
And you repaid our faith with treachery.
No, my lady.
Get out! Cat, I’ve…
I’ve loved you since I was a boy.
It seems to me that fate has given us this chance…
Have you lost your mind?
Get out! Do you want to see your girls again?
Sansa, more beautiful than ever?
And Arya, just as wild as ever?
You have Arya, too?
Both girls are healthy and safe.
For now.
But you know the queen and you know Joffrey.
I fear for their longevity if they remain in the capital.
What do you want?
The Lannisters will trade your daughters for the Kingslayer.
Of course they will.
Jaime Lannister for two girls?
Robb will never agree to those terms.
I’m not bringing these terms to him.
I’m bringing them to you.
You think I keep secrets from my son?
Robb has surprised them all with his skills in battle, but he’s not a mother.
Consider it, Cat.
You may not get another chance.
I’ve brought you a gift.
I don’t want your gifts.
A token of Tyrion Lannister’s goodwill.
He wants you to understand that this exchange of prisoners is offered in good faith.
Good faith?
What’s this?
Your husband was an honourable man.
He should rest beside his family in the crypts beneath Winterfell.
You may not believe…
Get out.
Get up, you dogs! That’s him, the one who picks.
The Mountain.
What are you doing?
He told me he stares at him every day.
That’s why he doesn’t get picked.
You.
Move, boy! Move! Is there gold and silver in the village?
I don’t know.
Gems?
I didn’t see any.
Where is the Brotherhood?
I don’t know.
Where is the Brotherhood?
I don’t know.
Please.
Where is the Brotherhood?
I don’t know.
Which of the villagers aided them?
I don’t know.
Who?
I…
Who?
I never saw.
Who?
I never saw.
Please.
Please, stop.
Please, it’s starting to…
Who?
I didn’t see anyone help him.
Take it off! Take it off! Who helped him?
Ganes, the butcher, and his son.
That’s better.
You’ve been very helpful.
No, stop, please! What are you doing?
Please, stop! Please, stop! No! No! I told you everything! No! No! Joffrey.
Cersei.
Ilyn Payne.
The Hound.
Please, Polliver.
Some food.
Just a crust of bread.
Polliver.
The Mountain.
Lady Stark, I had not thought to find you in the Stormlands.
I had not thought to be here, Lord Stannis.
Can that truly be you?
Who else might it be?
When I saw your standard, I couldn’t be sure.
Whose banner is that?
My own.
I suppose if we used the same one, the battle would be terribly confusing.
Why is your stag on fire?
The king has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the Lord of Light.
Ah, you must be this fire priestess we hear so much about.
Mmm, brother, now I understand why you found religion in your old age.
Watch yourself, Renly.
No, no, I’m relieved.
I never really believed you were a fanatic.
Charmless, rigid, a bore, yes, but not a godly man.
You should kneel before your brother.
He’s the Lord’s chosen, born amidst salt and smoke.
Born amidst salt and smoke?
Is he a ham?
That’s twice I’ve warned you.
Listen to yourselves.
If you were sons of mine, I would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers.
It is strange to find you beside my brother, Lady Stark.
Your husband was a supporter of my claim.
Lord Eddard’s integrity cost him his head.
And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me.
We share a common enemy.
The Iron Throne is mine by right.
All those that deny that are my foes.
The whole realm denies it, from Dorne to the Wall.
Old men deny it with their death rattle and unborn children deny it in their mother’s wombs.
No one wants you for their king.
You never wanted any friends, brother.
But a man without friends is a man without power.
For the sake of the mother who bore us, I will give you this one night to reconsider.
Strike your banners, come to me before dawn, and I will grant you your old seat in the Council.
I’ll even name you my heir until a son is born to me.
Otherwise I shall destroy you.
Look across those fields, brother.
Can you see all those banners?
You think a few bolts of cloth will make you king?
No.
The men holding those bolts of cloth will make me king.
We shall see, Renly.
Come the dawn, we shall see.
Look to your sins, Lord Renly.
The night is dark and full of terrors.
Would you believe I loved him once?
I thought we were welcome.
If you heard a Dothraki horde was approaching your city, you might do the same, Khaleesi.
Horde?
My name is Daenerys…
Daenerys Stormborn of the house Targaryen.
You know me, my lord?
Only by reputation, Khaleesi.
And I’m no lord, merely a humble merchant.
They call you the Mother of Dragons.
And what should I call you?
Oh, my name is quite long and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce.
I am simply a trader of spices.
But we are the Thirteen, charged with the governance and protection of Qarth, the greatest city that ever was or will be.
The beauty of Quarth is legendary…
Qarth.
Qarth.
Might we see the dragons?
My friend, we have travelled very far.
We have no food, no water.
Once I see my people fed, I would be honoured…
Forgive me, Mother of Dragons, but no man alive has seen a living dragon.
Some of my more sceptical friends refuse to believe your children even exist.
All we ask is the chance to see for ourselves.
I am not a liar.
Oh, I don’t think you are.
But as I’ve never met you before, my opinion on the matter is of limited value.
Where I come from, guests are treated with respect, not insulted at the gates.
Then perhaps you should return to where you come from.
We wish you well.
What are you doing?
You promised to receive me.
We have received you.
Here we are, and here you are.
If you do not let us in, all of us will die.
Which we shall deeply regret.
But Qarth did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be by letting Dothraki savages through its gates.
Khaleesi, please be careful.
Thirteen! When my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me.
We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground.
Turn us away and we will burn you first.
Ah.
You are a true Targaryen.
Only, as you said a moment ago, if we don’t let you into the city, you will all die.
And so…
Retreating in fear from a little girl is unbecoming of the greatest city that ever was or will be.
The discussion is over, Xaro Xhoan Daxos.
The Thirteen have spoken.
I am one of the Thirteen, and I am still speaking.
The girl threatens to burn our city to the ground and you would invite her in for a cup of wine?
She is the Mother of Dragons.
Do you expect her to watch her people starve without breathing fire?
I believe we can allow a few Dothraki through our gates without dooming our city.
After all, here I am, a savage from the Summer Isles, and Qarth still stands.
Our decision is final.
Very well.
I invoke soumai.
I will vouch for her, her people, and her dragons, in accordance with the law.
Be it on your head.
Welcome to Qarth, my lady.
You.
Is there gold or silver in the village?
I’m not from the village.
Where is the Brotherhood?
I don’t know what that is.
You two.
Take Lord Lannister’s things to his quarters.
What’s this?
We weren’t expecting you till tomorrow, Lord Tywin.
Evidently not.
Why are these prisoners not in their cells?
Cells are overflowing, my lord.
This lot won’t be here long.
Don’t need no permanent place.
After we interrogate ’em, we usually just…
Are we so wellmanned that we can afford to discard able young bodies and skilled labourers?
You, do you have a trade?
Smith, my lord.
What are you looking at?
Kneel! Kneel or I’ll carve your lungs out, boy.
He’ll do no such thing.
This one’s a girl, you idiot, dressed as a boy.
Why?
Safer to travel, my lord.
Smart.
More than I can say for this lot.
Get these prisoners to work.
Bring the girl.
I need a new cupbearer.
My lord.
Your visits are too few, cousin.
Her Grace, the Queen Regent, commands you to release Grand Maester Pycelle.
Here’s your warrant.
So it is.
Will you take a cup with me?
I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.
I am here at Her Grace’s behest, not to drink with you, Imp.
If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought she’d come herself.
Instead she sends you.
What am I to make of that?
I don’t care what you make of it, so long as you release your prisoner immediately.
And you’ve received these instructions directly from Cersei?
As I said several times.
And you’ve waited this long to deliver the information?
When the Queen Regent gives me a command, I carry it out without delay.
Cersei must have great trust in you, allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf.
The Queen Regent has a great many responsibilities.
She often works from dusk till dawn.
She must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn.
Ah.
Lavender oil.
She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl.
I am a knight! An anointed knight, yes.
Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed?
What?
Nothing to say?
No more warnings for me, ser?
You will withdraw these filthy accusations.
Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out you’ve been bedding his mother?
It’s not my fault! Did she take you against your will?
Can you not defend yourself, knight?
Your own father, Lord Tywin, when I was named the king’s squire, he told me to obey her in everything.
Did he tell you to fuck her, too?
I only meant I did as I was bid.
Hated every moment of it, is that what you’ll have me believe?
A high place in court, a knighthood, my sister’s legs spreading open for you at night.
Oh, yes, it must have been terrible.
Wait here.
His Grace will want to hear this.
Mercy! Mercy, my lord! I beg you.
Save it for Joffrey.
He loves a good grovel.
My lord, it was your sister’s bidding, the queen.
I’ll leave the city at once, I swear.
No, I think not.
My lord?
You heard me.
My father told you to obey my sister.
Obey her.
Stay close to her side.
Keep her trust.
Pleasure her whenever she requires.
No one ever need know, as long as you keep faith with me.
I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything.
And you will tell me.
Yes, my lord, I will.
I swear it, as you command.
Oh, rise, rise.
Let us drink to our understanding.
Oh, you don’t have a cup.
Oh, well.
Smile, cousin.
My sister is a beautiful woman, and it’s all for the good of the realm.
Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that, henceforth, I shall do nothing without her consent.
But her demands?
Oh, I’ll give her Pycelle.
You will?
Yes, I’ll release him in the morning.
Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council.
I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true.
Stay within one table length.
Your Grace.
Do your knucklebones bring you luck?
Well, life’s been good since you hacked them off, Your Grace.
And it’s four less fingernails to clean.
Fewer.
Pardon?
Four fewer fingernails to clean.
Never understood why you had to wear them.
It reminds me of where I come from and where I am now.
It reminds me of your justice.
It was an honest punishment and you were good with the cleaver.
You were a hero and a smuggler.
A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad the good.
A lesson I’ve tried to teach my son.
Does he listen?
To me?
Gods, no.
But if your red woman told him to leap from the crow’s nest…
She has a name.
I trust you’ve not forgotten your smuggler’s tricks.
I’ve lived within the law for …
I want you to be a smuggler this time.
Any shore, any night.
What am I bringing ashore?
The red woman.
No one must know what you do and we’ll not speak of this again.
I am true to Your Grace and always will be, but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways.
Cleaner ways don’t win wars.
Are you afraid, Onion Knight?
Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors.
You’ve carried more unpleasant cargo in your time.
Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?
I’d say my parts are mixed, my lady, good and bad.
If half an onion is black with rot, it’s a rotten onion.
A man is good or he is evil.
And which are you?
Oh, good.
I’m a knight myself, of sorts, a champion of light and life.
Well, that must be very nice for you.
Do you love your wife?
I do.
Yet you have known other women.
Don’t talk about my wife.
I’m not.
I’m talking about other women.
Like me, Ser Davos.
You want me.
You want to see what’s beneath this robe.
And you will.
Strange that this Lord of Light asks you to work in the shadows.
Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos.
They are servants of light, the children of fire.
And the brighter the flame, the darker they are.
These weren’t here before.
They’ve barred the passage.
They can’t bar our passage.
Gods protect us.
There’s only one god, Ser Davos, and he only protects those who serve him.To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
You swear it?
By the mother.
My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.
Then I see no reason for hostility between us.
Your son can go on calling himself King in the North.
The Starks will have dominion over all lands north of Moat Cailin, provided he swears me an oath of fealty.
And the wording of this oath?
The same Ned Stark swore to Robert years ago.
Cat, their friendship held the kingdoms together.
And in return for my son’s loyalty?
In the morning, I’ll destroy my brother’s army.
When that’s done, Baratheon and Stark will fight their common enemy together, as they have done many times before.
Our two houses have always been close, which is why I am begging you to reconsider this battle.
Negotiate a peace with your brother.
Negotiate with Stannis?
You heard him out there.
I’d have better luck debating the wind.
Please bring my terms to your son.
I believe we are natural allies.
I hope he feels the same.
Together we could end this war in a fortnight.
No!
No.
Follow me!
You’ll die for this.
No, wait, it wasn’t her!
We’ve got to leave.
They’ll hang you for this.
Now.
I won’t leave him.
You can’t avenge him if you’re dead.
Over there, go!
Not that way.
We need to go home.
Loras.
My lord, my lady.
Get out.
Stannis will be here in an hour.
When he arrives, Renly’s bannermen will flock to him.
Your former companions will fight for the privilege of selling you to their new king.
And you want that privilege for yourself.
You will note that I am standing here talking to you, not Stannis.
There’s no time for this.
Ride back to Highgarden, sister.
I’m not running from Stannis.
Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly.
I don’t believe that.
You don’t believe that.
Who gained the most from our king’s death?
Stannis.
I will put a sword through his righteous face.
You can’t stay here.
He would have been a true king, a good king.
Tell me, Ser Loras, what do you desire most in this world?
Revenge.
I have always found that to be the purest of motivations, but you won’t have a chance to put your sword through Stannis, not today.
You’ll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground.
If it is justice that you want, be smart about it.
You can’t avenge him from the grave.
Bring the horses.
Please.
He was very handsome.
He was, Your Grace.
“Your Grace.
” Calling yourself king doesn’t make you one.
And if Renly wasn’t a king, I wasn’t a queen.
Do you want to be a queen?
No.
I want to be the queen.
Killed?
By whom?
Accounts differ.
Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.
Really?
Who’d have thought?
Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour.
Whomever did it, I say well done.
It’s not what Varys says.
He says Renly’s army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea.
Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one.
And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money.
Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later.
Aren’t there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away?
She’ll be safer in Dorne.
Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety.
It so happens that I am.
Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I don’t blame her at all for you.
So clever.
Aren’t you always so clever with your schemes and your plots?
Schemes and plots are the same thing.
They are going to attack us.
We need to be ready.
No need to concern yourself over it.
The king is taking personal charge of siege preparations.
May I ask specifically what the king has in mind?
You may, specifically, or you may ask vaguely.
The answer will be the same.
It’s important that we talk about this.
It’s the king’s royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councillors.
It’s wildfire.
Wildfire?
You wouldn’t lie to me, would you, cousin?
No.
That’s a lie right there.
It is not a lie.
Why would I lie?
Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely?
When I tell him you’re fucking her, I mean.
I’m telling you the truth.
The smart money would be on more likely.
She’s making wildfire.
But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours.
The Alchemists’ Guild is being commissioned.
I suppose there’s only one way to find out.
They have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults.
They are planning to launch it from the city walls into Stannis’ ships and armies.
Please.
When did she tell you this?
I heard her talking with the pyromancer.
And the other night, after I left her, she went to meet him.
I swear to you.
Swear to me on what?
On my life.
But I don’t care about your life.
In the light of the Seven, by all that is holy and right, I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow…
All right, all right.
Enough.
Even torturing you is boring.
Just get out.
Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me.
Please kill me if anything should happen to Lord Tyrion.
It will be my pleasure.
Your Grace.
What is it?
I’m sorry about your brother, Your Grace.
I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him.
Fools love a fool.
I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was, not the man he grew to be.
I need to speak to you about what I saw in that cave.
I thought I made it clear to you there’d be no need to speak to me on this matter.
Your Grace, I…
I’ve never known you to need to hear a thing twice.
And I’ve never known you to hide from the truth.
You’ve come to lecture me on truth?
I’ve come to tell you that what I saw…
All my brother’s bannermen have come to my side.
Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards.
They won’t be able to resist us now.
Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne.
Nothing is worth what this will cost you, not even the Iron…
I’ll hear no more about it.
Take a company of men, secure the perimeter.
When do we sail for King’s Landing?
As soon as I’ve consolidated my troops.
We’ll make short work of the Lannisters’ fleet.
Once Blackwater Bay is cleared, we’ll deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city.
And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?
That’s not your concern.
If you take King’s Landing with her by your side, the victory will be hers.
I never thought I’d have reason to doubt your loyalty.
Was I wrong?
Loyal service means telling hard truths.
Oh, truth again.
All right, what’s the truth?
The hard truth?
She’s a foreigner preaching her foreign religion.
Some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey.
What do you believe?
You won those bannermen from Renly.
Don’t lose them to her.
We set out for King’s Landing without Lady Melisandre.
And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.
Your Grace, I’m honoured, but my time on the sea was spent evading ships, not attacking them.
The other lords won’t be happy.
Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky I don’t hang them for treason.
Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos.
I’ve got it!
I’ve got it!
So it’s that one there at the top, on the right.
Buy my fruit, my lord.
Fresh fruit.
Stannis has more infantry, more ships, more horses.
What do we have?
There’s that mind of yours you keep going on about.
Well, I’ve never actually been able to kill people with it.
Good thing.
I’d be out of a job.
What about your father?
He hasn’t sent a raven in weeks.
He’s very busy.
Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is timeconsuming.
We won’t be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffrey’s planning on holding it.
Corruption.
Yes!
We are swollen, bloated, foul.
Brother fornicates with sister in the bed of kings and we’re surprised when the fruit of their incest is rotten?
Yes, a rotten king.
It’s hard to argue with his assessment.
Not after what he did to your birthday present.
The king is a lost cause.
It’s the rest of us I’m worried about now.
A dancing king, prancing down his bloodstained halls to the tune of a twisted demon monkey.
You have to admire his imagination.
He’s talking about you.
What?
Demon monkey?
People think you’re pulling the king’s strings.
They blame you for the city’s ills.
Blame me?
I’m trying to save them.
You don’t need to convince me.
Demon monkey.
Yeah, come on.
You’re the crew of the Sea Bitch?
I’m your commander.
Welcome.
Stop.
Stop!
Your captain commands you to stop!
Where are we headed, Captain?
The Stony Shore, to raid their villages.
There’ll be spoils in it for you, and women, if you do your jobs well.
And who decides if we’ve done our jobs well?
I do.
Your captain.
I have been reaving and raping since before you left Balon’s balls, Captain.
Don’t reckon I’ve got much use for your ideas on how to do it.
Don’t reckon I’ve got much use for a captain at all.
I’m thinking I can do the job of captain real well myself.
All I need is a ship.
You wouldn’t know where I could find myself a ship now, would you?
You could do that, take the ship, head out on your own.
And I will hunt you down, drag you back here in chains and hang you for a traitor.
Stop.
We yield.
Congratulations on your first command.
Thank you.
Kind of you to come see me off.
Oh, I’m not here for you.
I was just on my way to Red Harbor.
I’ve got ships.
There’s nowhere to put them here.
Too narrow.
You’d better get out there.
Wouldn’t want her to set sail without you.
That would never happen.
My crew would wait on deck for a year if I asked them to.
This lot, though…
Enjoy the Stony Shore.
Come on, I’ll take you out.
Who are you?
Dagmer, your first mate.
Why aren’t you with the rest of them?
Or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea?
That would be good for a laugh.
They’re not gonna respect you until you prove yourself.
And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging pisspoor fishing villages?
You’re not.
And yet that’s the task my father has given me to prove that I’m a true Iron Islander.
They’re all Iron Islanders.
Do they do as they’re told or do they do as they like?
The Stony Shore’s not far from Torrhen’s Square.
The seat of the House of Tallhart, a more impressive prize than a few fishermen’s daughters.
What, you don’t think we could take it?
No, we could.
We could never hold it for more than a few days.
As soon as Winterfell got word that we’d taken Torrhen’s Square, the Starks would send their men to take it back.
And then…
Take me to my ship.
The Starks have overextended their lines.
Now that summer’s over, they’ll have a hard time keeping their men and horses fed.
The Starks understand winter better than we ever will.
The cold won’t beat them.
Our spies report growing discontent among the Northern lords.
They want to return home and gather the harvest before the crops turn.
And I’m sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments, they would report growing discontent amongst the Southern lords.
This is war, no one’s content.
We’ve underestimated the Stark boy for too long.
He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him.
And as long as he keeps winning battles, they’ll keep believing he is King in the North.
You’ve been waiting for him to fail.
He is not going to fail, not without our help.
So how do we stop him?
We’ve worked through the night, my lord.
Perhaps we’d profit from some sleep.
Yes, I think you would, Reginald.
And because you’re my cousin, I might even let you wake from that sleep.
Go, I’m sure your wife must miss you.
My wife’s in Lannisport.
Well, then you’d better start riding.
Go, before I change my mind and send her your head.
If your name wasn’t Lannister, you’d be scrubbing out pots in the cook’s tent.
Go!
Not wine, water.
We’ll be here for some time.
Girl.
Where are you from?
Maidenpool, my lord.
And who are the Lords of Maidenpool?
Remind me.
House Mooton, my lord.
And what is their sigil?
A red salmon.
I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that.
You’re a Northerner, aren’t you?
Good.
One more time, where are you from?
Barrowton, my lord.
House Dustin.
Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown.
And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North?
They call him the Young Wolf.
And?
They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf.
They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants.
They say he can’t be killed.
And do you believe them?
No, my lord.
Anyone can be killed.
Fetch that water.
A girl says nothing.
A girl keeps her mouth closed.
No one hears, and friends may talk in secret, yes?
A boy becomes a girl.
I was always a girl.
And I was always aware.
But the girl keeps secrets.
It is not for a man to spoil them.
You’re one of them now.
I should have let you burn.
And you fetch water for one of them now.
Why is this right for you and wrong for me?
I didn’t have a choice.
You did.
I did.
And here we are.
A man pays his debts.
A man owes three.
Three what?
The Red God takes what is his, lovely girl.
And only death may pay for life.
You saved me and the two I was with.
You stole three deaths from the Red God.
We have to give them back.
Speak three names and the man will do the rest.
Three lives I will give you, no more, no less, and we’re done.
I can name anyone and you’ll kill him?
A man has said.
The one who tortures everyone.
A man needs a name.
I don’t know his name.
They call him the Tickler.
That is enough.
Go now, girl.
Your master is thirsty.
He’s not here yet.
He’d have seen us, blown the horn.
When will he come?
The Halfhand does things in his own time.
My uncle told me stories about him.
Most of them are true.
I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.
The whole winter.
He was north of the Skirling Pass when the snows came.
Had to wait for the thaw.
So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own.
Well, possible for the Halfhand.
Beautiful, isn’t it?
Gilly would love it here.
There’s nothing more sickening than a man in love.
About time you did something.
At least you’ll keep warm.
The Fist of the First Men.
Think of how old this place is.
Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals, before the Andals took Westeros from the First Men.
Before I die, please, stop talking.
Thousands and thousands of years ago, the First Men stood here where we’re standing all through the long night.
What do you think they were like, the First Men?
Stupid.
Smart people don’t find themselves in places like this.
I think they were afraid.
I think they came here to get away from something.
And I don’t think it worked.
Wildlings?
One blast is for rangers returning.
Wildlings is two blasts.
So you got to stand there waiting, wondering.
One blast for friends, two for foes.
And three for White Walkers.
It’s been a thousand years, but that’s the only time they blow the horn three times.
But if it’s been a thousand years, how do you know?
Well…
I read it in a book.
Look.
It’s Qhorin Halfhand.
Aye, we’ll live another day.
Hurrah.
Take care, my lord.
I remember reading an old sailors’ proverb, “Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off.
” Oh, I have not conducted this experiment.
It could well be true.
The substance burns so hot, it melts wood, stone, even steel, and, of course, flesh.
The substance burns so hot, it melts flesh like tallow.
After the dragons died, wildfire was the key to the Targaryen power.
My companion takes issue.
If I could tell you how many crazy old men I’ve seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit.
No offence meant.
Our order does not deal in pig shit.
The substance is fire given form.
And we have been perfecting it since the days of Maegor.
To do what?
The jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy.
How much do you have?
If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults, then maybe you’d hit your target one time in ten, but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father.
My lord, this man is insulting.
I don’t know if you’ve ever seen a battle, old man, but things can get a bit messy.
‘Cause when we’re flinging things at Stannis, he’s flinging them right back at us.
Men die, men shit themselves, men run, which means pots falling, which means fire inside the walls, which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down.
My friend remains unconvinced.
He would not dare insult my order whilst Aerys Targaryen lived.
Well, he’s not living any more.
And all his pots of wildfire didn’t help him, did they?
Men win wars, not magic tricks.
We have been working tirelessly, day and night, ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so.
Our present count stands at ,.
Enough to burn Stannis Baratheon’s fleet and armies both.
This is a shit idea.
I’m afraid I have to concur with my adviser, Wisdom Hallyne.
The contents of this room could lay King’s Landing low.
You won’t be making wildfire for my sister any longer.
You’ll be making it for me.
He’ll be able to feed himself from now on.
Let him sleep, Doreah.
Yes, Khaleesi.
He loves you.
I rewove this part of the top.
And I fixed the heel on this one.
Thank you, my friend.
Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you?
They say he’s the wealthiest man in Qarth.
It is known.
And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos…
The last time a rich man gave me a dress, he was selling me to Khal Drogo.
May he ride forever through the night lands.
Xaro is our host, but we know nothing about him.
Men like to talk about other men when they’re happy.
You would look like a real princess in Xaro’s…
She’s not a princess.
She’s a Khaleesi.
You should wear it, Khaleesi.
You are their guest.
It would be rude not to.
And you must visit the night market.
The Qartheen night market is like no night market you’ve ever seen.
It sounds wonderful.
The Meereenis think they have a night market.
I will take you there myself.
Please excuse me for a moment.
What are they doing?
Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry.
Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot.
They can pry out the gems, the rest is pure gold.
Very soft.
He can chop off as much as we can carry.
Or melt it.
Very simple.
We are his guests!
You can’t pry it or chop it or melt it.
Of course not, Khaleesi!
We will wait until we leave.
Not even when we leave.
Why not?
Our host saved us from the Red Waste and you want to steal from him?
I will hear no more.
My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built.
It’s not the only thing.
They’re quite good at killing the better men.
That’s not the kind of queen I’m going to be.
Mother of Dragons.
On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth, I welcome you.
A demonstration?
Take this gem.
Look at it.
Into its depths.
So many facets.
Look closely enough and you can see yourself in them.
Often more than once.
Should you grow tired of Xaro’s baubles and trinkets, it would be an honour to host you at the House of the Undying.
You are always welcome, Mother of Dragons.
My apologies.
Pyat Pree is one of the Thirteen.
It was customary for me to extend him an invitation.
Customs die slow deaths in Qarth.
What is the House of the Undying?
It is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books and drink shade of the evening.
It turns their lips blue and their minds soft.
So soft, they actually believe their parlour tricks are magic.
You watch over her.
Do I know you?
I know you.
Jorah Mormont of Bear Island.
Who are you?
I’m no one.
But she is the Mother of Dragons.
She needs true protectors, now more than ever.
They shall come day and night to see the wonder born into the world again.
And when they see, they shall lust, for dragons are fire made flesh.
And fire is power.
It looked like Stannis.
To me it just looked like…
A shadow in the shape of a man.
In the shape of Stannis.
We should reach my son’s camp tomorrow.
Will you stay there long, my lady?
Only long enough to tell Robb what I have seen.
After that, I will leave for Winterfell.
My two youngest need me.
I’ve been away from them for far too long.
I never knew my mother.
I’m sorry.
My own mother died on the birthing bed when I was very young.
It’s a bloody business.
What comes after is even harder.
Once you’re safely back amongst your own people, will you give me leave to go, my lady?
You mean to kill Stannis.
I swore a vow.
But Stannis has a great army around him.
His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.
I’m as good as any of them.
I should never have fled.
Renly’s death was no fault of yours.
You served him bravely.
I only held him that once as he was dying.
He’s gone, Brienne.
You serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth.
Renly’s enemies are Robb’s enemies as well.
I do not know your son, my lady.
But I could serve you, if you would have me.
You have courage.
Not battle courage, perhaps, but, I don’t know, a woman’s kind of courage.
And I think that when the time comes, you will not hold me back.
Promise me that you will not hold me back from Stannis.
When the time comes, I will not hold you back.
Then I am yours, my lady.
I will shield your back and give my life for yours, if it comes to that.
I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.
I vow that you shall always have a place in my home and at my table and that I shall ask no service of you that might bring you dishonour.
I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.
And it’s not just thieves, my lord.
There’s wolves in them hills now, more than I ever seen.
They come down in the night and they kill my sheep.
My three sons is away fighting for your brother, my lord.
They’ll fight, keep fighting till they’re told to go home.
I have no one to man my flock now.
Only me.
I can’t keep watch all day and all night.
We can send two orphan boys from Winterstown home with you to help watch over your flock if you can give them room and board.
My wife always prayed for more children.
We’ll look after them.
Thank you, my lord.
And may the gods bless you and yours.
Stop it.
If that’s everyone, I’m going to go for a ride before dark.
Good.
Hodor.
Hodor.
Ah!
Lord Stark.
Torrhen’s Square is under siege.
Torrhen’s Square is barely leagues from here.
How can the Lannisters strike so far north?
Might be a raiding party led by the mountain.
Might be sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister.
We have to help them.
Most of the fighting men are away with Robb, but I can gather decent men.
Do you need so many?
If we can’t protect our own bannermen, why should they protect us?
Go, Ser Rodrik.
Take the men you need.
Won’t take long, my lord.
Southerners don’t do well up here.
So, what does it mean?
Ask your Maester Luwin.
He’s the one studying books all the time.
I did ask him.
He’d never heard of a threeeyed raven.
Must not mean anything, then.
You’re lying.
You might be a little lord, but don’t you call me a liar.
You know what it means.
I never said I didn’t.
You didn’t give me an honest answer.
That’s not the same as being a liar.
Well, it’s not far off.
So, you’ve been dreaming of a threeeyed raven again?
In the godswood, you told me you didn’t dream.
Now who’s a liar?
What did you see in your dream?
Something bad?
Tell me, boy.
I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell.
I saw waves crashing against the gates and the water came flowing over the walls…
It flooded the castle.
Drowned men were floating here, in the yard.
Ser Rodrik was one of them.
The sea is hundreds of miles away.
I know.
It’s just a stupid dream.
I’ve got to get these potatoes to the kitchen.
Otherwise they’ll put me in chains again.
Osha.
The threeeyed raven, what do they say about it north of the Wall?
They say all sorts of crazy things north of the Wall.
There.
Where?
On that mountain.
I don’t see very well.
A fire.
There’s a fire.
The people sitting around it have better eyes than yours or mine.
When they see us coming, that fire becomes a signal.
Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time to throw a party in our honour.
How many wildlings have joined him?
From what we can tell, all of them.
Mance has gathered them all like deer against the wolves.
They’re almost ready to make their move.
Where?
Somewhere safe.
Somewhere south.
Can’t just march into their midst.
And we can’t wait for them here with nothing but a pile of stones to protect us.
You saying we should fall back to the Wall?
Mance was one of us once.
Now he’s one of them.
He’s going to teach them our way of doing things.
They’ll hit us in force and they won’t run away when we hit back.
They’re gonna be more organised than before, more disciplined, more like us.
So we need to be more like them, do things their way.
Sneak in, kill Mance, and scatter them to the winds before they can march on the Wall.
And to do that…
We need to get rid of those lookouts.
It’s not a job for men.
I need to move fast and silent.
Harker, Stonesnake, Borba.
Lord Commander, I’d like to join Lord Qhorin.
I’ve been called lots of things, but that might be my first Lord Qhorin.
You’re a steward, Snow, not a ranger.
I’ve fought and killed a wight.
How many rangers can say that?
He’s the one?
Aye.
You killed a wight.
You also let an old man beat you bloody and take your sword.
Craster?
In the boy’s defence, that’s a tough old goat.
I could take up Jon’s duties while he’s gone, my lord.
It would be no trouble.
Well, I hope you make a better ranger than you do a steward.
Go on.
So, tell me, how long has your manservant been in love with you?
He’s not my manservant and he’s not in love with me.
He’s my adviser, my friend.
Unlikely.
I can almost always tell what a man wants.
And what about what a woman wants?
Much more complicated.
You, for example, what do you want?
To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne.
Why?
Because I promised my khalasar I’d protect them and find them a safe home.
You want to conquer the Seven Kingdoms for the Dothraki?
I want them because they’re mine by right.
The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it.
Ah, a conqueror.
And how did you get all of this?
Did someone give it to you?
No.
I come from nothing.
I hit the docks like a piece of cargo, except someone normally cares what happens to cargo.
So you wanted more than you had and you took it.
You’re a conqueror, too.
You’re just less ambitious.
What do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos?
At the gates of the city, you bled for me.
Why?
I will show you why.
The door and the vault is made of Valyrian stone.
The hardest steel does not make a mark.
I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth their weight in gold if they could break into it.
I made the same offer to the greatest thieves.
They all went home emptyhanded.
The only thing that can open this door is this key.
And behind the door?
And it can all be mine?
All?
Let us say half.
More than enough to buy horses, ships, armies…
Enough to go home.
All I have to do?
Is marry me.
That was a romantic proposal.
I’ve already married once for love, but the gods stole her from me.
I come from nothing.
My mother and father never owned a pair of shoes.
But marry me, and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms and our children will be princes and princesses.
See?
I have more ambition than you thought.
The time is right, Daenerys Targaryen, First of Your Name.
Robert Baratheon is dead.
If you cross the sea with an army you bought…
The Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another.
Four false kings destroying the country.
To win Westeros, you need support from Westeros.
The usurper is dead.
The Starks fight the Lannisters, and Baratheons fight each other.
According to your new friend who earned your trust by cutting his hand?
The time to strike is now.
We need to find ships and an army or we’ll spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world.
Rich men do not become rich by giving more than they get.
They’ll give you ships and soldiers and they’ll own you forever.
Moving carefully is the hard way, but it’s the right way.
And if I’d listened to that advice outside the gates of Qarth, we’d all be dead by now.
I know the opportunity before you seems like the last you’ll ever have, but you must…
Do not speak to me like I’m a child.
I only want…
What do you want?
Tell me.
To see you on the Iron Throne.
Why?
You have a good claim.
A title.
A birthright.
But you have something more than that.
You may cover it up and deny it, but you have a gentle heart.
You would not only be respected and feared, you would be loved.
Someone who can rule and should rule.
Centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world.
There are times when I look at you and I still can’t believe you’re real.
So what would you have me do, as my adviser?
Make your own way.
Find your own ship.
You only need one.
The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth.
And how do I get the ship?
I’ll find it for you.
A sound ship with a good captain.
I look forward to meeting him.
Khaleesi.
You should stand sideface.
Sideface?
Sideways.
Why?
Smaller target.
Am I fighting someone?
You’re practising for a fight.
You should practise right.
Guards!
Did you see anything?
Go up there.
Go and see where he fell from.
Go up the battlement.
Move away.
Stand back.
He’s dead.To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
I’ve taken your castle.
Theon?
It’s Prince Theon now.
Get up.
You have to get dressed.
I’ve taken Winterfell.
I took it.
I’m occupying it.
I sent men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes.
Why?
To take the castle.
You went with Robb.
And he sent me back to Pyke.
I’m a Greyjoy.
I can’t fight for Robb and my father both.
Where’s Hodor?
I don’t know.
Find the halfwit.
My men are bringing your people together in the courtyard.
Why?
So you and I can go down and tell them how you’ve yielded Winterfell to me.
I won’t.
Yes, you will.
I won’t.
I’ll never yield.
We’ll fight you and throw you out.
The castle is mine.
But these people are still yours.
You’ll yield to keep them safe, to keep them alive.
That’s what a good lord would do.
Think carefully about what you want to say.
Theon.
Did you hate us the whole time?
I’ve yielded Winterfell to Theon.
Louder.
Say Prince Theon.
I’ve yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon.
You all know me.
Aye, we know you for a steaming sack of shit.
Farlen, you be silent.
Listen to your little lord, Farlen.
He has more sense than you do.
All of you should do as he commands.
My father has donned the ancient crown of Salt and Rock and declared himself King of the Iron Islands.
He claims the North as well by right of conquest.
You are all his subjects.
Bugger that.
I serve the Starks.
If you think you can hold the North with it…
Shut up!
If you serve me as loyally as you served Ned Stark, I will be as good to you as he ever was.
Steady.
Betray me, and you will wish you hadn’t.
Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke informing my father of my victory here.
And one to Deepwood Motte to my sister.
Inform her that she’s to bring men to Winterfell.
You are a maester of the Citadel, sworn to serve the Lord of Winterfell, are you not?
I am.
I am the Lord of Winterfell as Bran just informed you.
Send the ravens.
My lord.
My Lord Greyjoy.
I see you’ve finally learned how to address your betters.
What do you want?
I was brought here a captive.
You were here the day I was taken.
I’m the one who took you.
What of it?
Let me serve you.
Serve me how?
I need fighters, not kitchen sluts.
It was Robb Stark who put me in the kitchens.
Put a spear in my hand again.
So you can bury it in my neck?
Do you take me for a fool?
Get up.
Step aside.
Why?
It’s your dream, little lord.
The ocean has come to swallow this place.
I ain’t letting it drown me.
You’ll all go about your tasks as usual.
And in a few days’ time…
Greyjoy!
We caught this one on his way back from Torrhen’s Square.
Took out two of ours before I got his sword.
Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that we meet as foes.
It grieves me you’ve less honour than a back alley whore.
You were raised here under this roof.
These people are your people.
They are not my people.
King Robb thought of you as a brother.
My brothers are dead.
They died fighting Stark men, men like you.
Aye, they died fighting a war your father started.
Lord Stark raised you among his own sons.
Among them, but not one of them.
I was his hostage, taken from my home.
If he were alive to see this…
He’s not.
He’s dead.
The Seven Kingdoms are at war.
And Winterfell is mine.
I should have put a sword in your belly instead of in your hand.
You’ve served this house faithfully, old man.
But keep talking and I’ll…
Take him to the cells.
Lock him up…
My prince.
You cannot let that stand.
He must pay.
I’ll lock him in a cell until he rots.
No, he has to pay the iron price.
They’ll never respect you while he lives.
Ser Rodrik, I sentence you to death!
No!
You said no harm would come to them if I yielded.
The old man couldn’t keep his mouth shut.
I urge you not to make a hasty decision.
He disrespected me in front of my men.
That was his decision, not mine.
He is worth more to you alive than dead.
The Starks will pay.
Please, Theon, think what you do.
You’ll address me as Prince Theon or you’ll be next.
Come.
No!
No!
Theon!
Rodrik!
He who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
I’m begging you.
Coward.
Stop.
Stop!
Stop right now!
You don’t give commands any more, little lord.
Please, stop this.
Please stop him.
Hush now, child.
I’m off to see your father.
You said no harm would come!
You said no harm would come.
Theon, please.
Any last words, old man?
Gods help you, Theon Greyjoy.
Now you are truly lost.
Theon, please don’t.
Do something!
I’ll do anything, please!
No, please stop it!
Ghost, stay with us.
Ghost!
There goes your pet.
He’s not a pet.
No, you’re right, he’s not.
You can’t tame a wild thing.
You can’t trust a wild thing.
Ghost is different.
So you think.
Wild creatures have their own rules, their own reasons.
And you’ll never know them.
Now the wildlings we’re looking for sleep during the day and hunt at night.
I thought you said you couldn’t know wild things.
I said you can’t.
They find a nice cave to hide in while the sun’s up and do their killing when it’s dark.
We could do the same.
No, we couldn’t.
This is their country.
They know where to walk, where not to walk.
I’ve lost good men who fell into a crevasse they didn’t see till they were in it.
My father always said I’m of the North.
I wasn’t joking.
Look around, boy.
This look like home to you?
You start thinking you know this place, it will kill you.
You understand me?
No, you don’t.
We’re at war.
We’ve always been at war.
It’s never going to end ’cause we’re not fighting an enemy.
We’re fighting the North, and it’s not going anywhere.
The Watch has given you a great gift.
You only have one thing to give in return, your life.
I’ll gladly give my life.
I don’t want you to be glad about it.
I want you to curse and fight until your heart’s done pumping.
And know this, boy.
Your death will be a gift for them south of the Wall.
They’ll never know what you’ve done.
They’ll never know how you died.
They won’t even know your damn name.
But they’ll be alive because some nameless bastard north of the Wall gave his life for theirs.
Now, do you understand me?
I do.
You’re even dumber than you look.
It’s just words, boy, to keep us a little warmer in the night.
Make us feel like we’ve got a purpose.
Come on.
We’ve got to find these goat fuckers before night falls and they find us.
Can you read?
My lord?
Can you read?
This letter detailing our infantry movements was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand.
It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.
My apologies, my lord.
I must have…
Girl, fetch me the History of the Greater and the Lesser Houses.
It’s the one on this…
My cupbearer can read better than you.
To whom does House Dormand owe allegiance?
My lord, I…
To the Starks of Winterfell!
Who have , men and my son!
I judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants.
I see I overestimated you.
If you ever put my son’s life at risk again, I’ll…
Leave us.
Put the book away, girl.
Maybe you should devise our next battle plan while you’re about it.
Lord Petyr Baelish.
Mmm.
Give us the room.
Clear all this.
Lord Tywin.
Baelish.
Wine?
Thank you.
What news from the capital?
I travelled here directly from Renly Baratheon’s camp.
Ah, the late King Renly.
Rather a short reign.
Murdered by a woman, I hear.
So they say.
There has been talk of other forces at work.
Dark forces.
Here.
Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel.
It is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after.
You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it.
Yes, a crisis is an opportunity.
What other brilliant insights have you brought me today?
After the Lannisters and the Starks, the Tyrells command the largest host.
Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven Kingdoms, feeding horses and soldiers.
Yes, yes, yes.
The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings.
Loras wants revenge.
He blames Stannis for Renly’s death.
And Margaery…
Wants to be queen.
Yes, she does.
House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne.
Against my grandson.
They did.
And perhaps that treason should be punished one day, after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated.
More wine for Lord Baelish.
If you will allow me to represent your family’s interests, I believe that an advantageous agreement…
The Tyrell host has returned to Highgarden?
They have.
Pardon, my lord.
It’s only wine.
You would ride there yourself?
Tonight, with your leave.
I’ll have an answer by nightfall.
That’ll be all, girl.
And what else?
On your son Tyrion’s directive, I met with Catelyn Stark.
Why?
He had an interesting proposal for her concerning her daughters.
Hmm.
A girl.
A wildling.
We could question her.
You could.
She won’t answer.
I’ve known a wildling to bite off his tongue instead of talking.
What’s your name?
Ygritte.
She was reaching for this axe when you got to her.
Give her half a chance, she’ll bury it in your face.
I gave you my name.
I’m Jon Snow.
You ought to burn them you killed.
We’d need a big fire for that.
Tell me, Ygritte.
Why do you want us to build a big fire?
Are there some more friends in the area?
Burn them or maybe you’ll need those swords again.
Our boy here’s already killed one dead man.
He can do it again if he has to.
What waits beyond the pass?
The free folk.
How many?
Hundreds and thousands.
More than you’ve ever seen, crow.
Why come to the mountains?
What’s in the Frostfangs your king could want?
Do you mean to march on the Wall?
Do you know who I am, girl?
Qhorin Halfhand.
Tell me true.
If your people captured me, would they take me prisoner?
They’d take your head off your shoulders if they was feeling kind.
If not, they’d kill you slow.
We have no food for her.
Can’t spare a man to watch her.
Can’t let her go.
She’ll bring Mance Rayder’s army down on us.
It needs to be done.
Want me to do it?
No.
No, I’ll do it.
Come, brothers.
We’ll leave him to it.
We’ll meet you at the top.
Don’t take too long.
We’re deep in their country now.
You never killed a woman before, did you?
You don’t need to do it.
Mance would take you.
I know he would.
There’s secret ways.
The crows would never catch us.
I’m as much a crow as they are.
Will you burn me?
After?
Can’t.
Someone might see the smoke.
Strike hard and true, Jon Snow, or I’ll come back and haunt you.
That’s cold.
Go on.
Be quick about it.
Do it.
Bastard, do it!
You can’t do it.
We both know it.
The sun’s going down, Jon Snow.
And your friends are nowhere close.
I’ll find them.
Call for them.
Go on.
Call loudly.
May the Seven guide the princess on her journey.
May the Mother give her health.
May the crone give her wisdom.
May the warrior give her courage.
One day I pray you love someone.
I pray you love her so much, when you close your eyes, you see her face.
I want that for you.
I want you to know what it’s like to love someone, to truly love someone.
Before I take her from you.
You sound like a little cat mewling for his mother.
Princes don’t cry.
I saw you cry.
Did you say something, my lady?
My little brother cried when I left Winterfell.
So?
It seems a normal thing.
Is your little brother a prince?
No.
Not really relevant then, is it?
Come, dog.
Hail Joffrey!
Hail to the King.
Seven blessings on you, Your Grace.
Murderer!
Bastard!
All hail the king.
He’s no king.
He’s a bastard!
Please, Your Grace, we’re hungry.
Freak.
Get the prince back to the Keep now.
Yes, my lord.
Come, quickly.
Please, Your Grace, give us some food!
Bread, Your Grace, please!
Who threw that?
I want the man who threw that.
Find who did that and bring him to me!
Hold on!
Hold them back!
Just kill them!
Kill them all!
Move.
Move!
Pull back!
Tear him to pieces!
What are you doing?
I want these people executed!
And they want the same for you.
Where’s Sansa?
Through the door.
Come on.
Push hard.
Protect the king!
Get back!
Fall back!
Keep him safe!
Brotherfucker!
Watch out.
Hold them back.
Hey.
Traitors!
I’ll have all their heads.
You blind, bloody fool.
You can’t insult me.
We’ve had vicious kings and we’ve had idiot kings, but I don’t know if we’ve ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king.
You can’t…
I can, I am.
They attacked me!
They threw a cow pie at you, so you decided to kill them all?
They’re starving, you fool.
All because of a war you started.
You’re talking to a king!
And now I’ve struck a king.
Did my hand fall from my wrist?
Where is the Stark girl?
Let them have her.
If she dies, you’ll never get your Uncle Jaime back.
You owe him quite a bit, you know.
Where are you going?
You ever been fucked, little girl?
Come here.
Take some men and go and find the Stark girl.
I take my orders from the king.
Where?
This way.
Please!
No!
No!
Please!
You’re all right now, little bird.
You’re all right.
We’ll get you.
We’ll get you.
This way.
Are you hurt, my lady?
The little bird’s bleeding.
Someone take her back to her cage.
See to that cut.
Well done, Clegane.
I didn’t do it for you.
He shouldn’t make me wait.
The Spice King is the second wealthiest man in Qarth.
He makes everyone wait.
Of course, you could have avoided this embarrassment if you married the wealthiest man in Qarth.
I already have a husband.
Khal Drogo is gone, Khaleesi.
You are far too young to be a widow forever and far too beautiful.
And you are far too smart to think that I will succumb to flattery.
I have travelled very far in my life and met many women, but none that are immune to flattery.
The Mother of Dragons!
Here he comes.
Forgive me.
I had terrible dreams last night.
Terrible dreams.
I could not sleep until the sun was shining and the birds were singing.
Look what a beauty you are now the Red Waste has been washed off you.
I am sorry about all that unpleasantness.
The silver hair of a true Targaryen.
Xaro Xhoan Daxos, she is far too lovely for a glorified dockworker like yourself.
Very true, and yet they say that your grandfather, who sold pepper off the back of a wagon, married a lady far lovelier and higher born than himself.
Every lady alive was lovelier and higher born than my grandfather.
Did my servants not offer you something to eat, to drink?
I’ll have them flogged in the square.
Thank you, my lord.
You are a gracious host, but there is no servant alive that can bring me what I want.
Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one.
So, my little princess, what is it you want?
My birthright.
The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.
I fear I’m no better than a servant in this regard.
I cannot give you what I do not have.
I’m not asking you for the kingdoms.
I’m asking you for ships.
I need to cross the Narrow Sea.
I need my ships as well.
I use them, you see, to bring spices from one port to another.
Whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when I retake the Iron Throne.
Retake?
Did you once sit on the Iron Throne?
My father sat there, before he was murdered.
But if you did not sit on it yourself, would it not be correct to say “take the Iron Throne”?
I didn’t come here to argue grammar.
Of course not.
You came to take my ships.
So let me explain my position, little princess.
Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors.
I make my living by trade.
And I judge every trade on its merits.
You ask for ships.
You say I shall be repaid triple.
I do not doubt your honesty or your intentions.
But before you repay your debts, you must seize the Seven Kingdoms.
Do you have an army?
Not yet.
You do not have an army.
Do you have powerful allies in Westeros?
There are many there that support my claim.
When were you there last?
I left when I was a baby.
So, in truth, you have no allies.
The people will rise to fight for their rightful queen when I return.
Ah.
Forgive me, little princess, but I cannot make an investment based on wishes and dreams.
Now if you’ll pardon me.
Do you know Illyrio Mopatis, Magister of Pentos?
Yes, we’ve met.
A shrewd man.
For my wedding, he gave me three petrified dragon eggs.
He believed…
The world believed that the ages had turned them to stone.
How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies?
But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs into a great fire, they would hatch.
When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad.
But when the fire burned out, I was unhurt, the Mother of Dragons.
Do you understand?
I’m no ordinary woman.
My dreams come true.
I admire your passion.
But in business, I trust in logic, not passion.
I’m sorry, little princess.
I am not your little princess.
I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of Old Valyria, and I will take what is mine.
With fire and blood, I will take it.
Yes, my lady, but not with my ships.
Who taught you to read?
My father, my lord.
Hmm.
I taught my son Jaime to read.
The maester came to me one day, told me he wasn’t learning.
He couldn’t make sense of the letters.
He reversed them in his head.
The maester said he’d heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it.
Ha!
After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned.
He hated me for it, for a time.
For a long time.
But he learned.
Hmm.
Where is your father?
Is he alive?
Who was he?
A stonemason.
A stonemason who could read?
Hmm.
He taught himself.
Quite a man.
What killed him?
Loyalty.
You’re a sharp little thing, aren’t you?
Did…
Forgive me, my lord.
I shouldn’t ask questions.
No.
But you’ve already begun.
Did you know your father, my lord?
I did.
I grew up with him.
I watched him grow old.
He loved us.
He was a good man, but a weak man.
A weak man who nearly destroyed our house and name.
I’m cold.
I’ll fetch more wood for the fire, my lord.
Mmm.
Where are you going, girl?
The armoury, my lord.
Why?
Lord Tywin sent me.
What might this be?
Lord Tywin gave it to me.
What for?
To take to the armoury.
Why would he do that?
Let’s go and ask him.
Move!
Get out of the way!
Amory Lorch.
A girl has named a second name.
A man will do what must be done.
Now!
A girl cannot tell a man when exactly he must do a thing.
A man cannot make a thing happen before its time.
But he’s going to tell Tywin.
He’s getting away.
It has to be now.
Guard!
Your Grace.
Your Grace.
My honour, Your Grace.
Your Grace.
Your Grace.
Quent.
Lady Talisa.
Your Grace.
I’m not sure I’m a lady.
Westerosi customs are still a bit foreign to me.
It’s hard to keep all the rules straight.
But if I remember my lessons, a woman of noble birth is always called a lady.
Unless she’s a queen or a princess.
I could find someone who knows.
Why are you so sure I’m of noble birth?
Because it’s obvious.
What if I told you my father sold lace on the Long Bridge, and my mother, my brother and I lived with him above our shop?
I’d call you a liar.
Not very noble to accuse a lady of dishonesty.
I always thought I was a brilliant liar.
Better at amputations, I’m afraid.
Quite a pretty spot.
Will we be here long?
I couldn’t really discuss troop movements with you.
I’m not a spy.
Of course, a spy would deny being a spy.
You’re right.
You’ve found me out.
I’m writing a letter to the Lannisters.
“The young wolf is on the move.
” Perhaps you’d join me.
If you’ve got time, of course, for, well…
Robb.
Mother.
Mother, this is Lady Talisa.
She’s been helping with the wounded.
She’s been very helpful.
Lady Talisa.
Lady Stark.
Lady Talisa…
Maegyr.
Maegyr?
Forgive me, I do not know this name.
An uncommon name here.
An old name in Volantis.
Excuse me, my lady.
Your Grace.
I’ve missed you.
Yes, you look positively forlorn.
You surprised me, that’s all.
I didn’t think I’d see you today.
I wish that you were free to follow your heart.
I know.
You have inherited your father’s responsibilities.
I’m afraid they come at a cost.
You are promised to another.
I know.
A debt that must be paid.
I haven’t forgotten.
Your Grace.
My lady.
News from Winterfell.
Your brothers desert you?
I can tell you which way to go.
We’ll stop here.
Too dark to go any farther today.
Here?
There’s no shelter here.
There’s no shelter anywhere.
There is…
if you know where to look.
The cold could kill us both.
If you light a fire…
No fire.
But a fire is…
No fire.
Have it your way.
We’ll stay warmer if we stay close.
Bet you freeze to death before I do.
Bet your life.
Think they’re out looking for you?
Yes.
Think they’ll find you?
Yes.
You’re brave.
Stupid, but brave.
We start again at first light.
Get some sleep.
Stop moving.
I’m just trying to get comfortable.
Stop it!
You’re still moving.
Was I?
I didn’t notice that time.
This cannot be true.
We’ve had ravens from White Harbour, Barrowton and the Dreadfort.
I’m afraid it is true.
Why?
Why would Theon…
Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores.
My brothers?
We’ve heard nothing of them.
But Rodrik Cassel is dead.
I told you, never trust a Greyjoy!
I must go north at once.
There’s still a war to win, Your Grace.
How can I call myself king if I can’t hold my own castle?
How can I ask men to follow me if I can’t…
You are a king.
And that means you don’t have to do everything yourself.
Let me go and talk to Theon.
There will be no talk.
He will die for this.
Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew.
Let me send word to my bastard at the Dreadfort.
He can raise a few hundred men and retake Winterfell before the new moon.
We have the Lannisters on the run.
If you march all the way back north now, you’ll lose what you gained.
My boy would be honoured to bring you Prince Theon’s head.
Tell your son Bran and Rickon’s safety is paramount.
And Theon, I want him brought to me alive.
I want to look him in the eye and ask him why.
And then I’ll take his head myself.
Why on earth would I trust the word of a lying little savage like you?
I’m no liar.
All wildlings are liars and savages with no loyalty to anything or anyone.
I done what I had to do to stay alive.
I hate the Starks as well as you do.
Let me serve you, my lord.
How?
And don’t tell me to put a spear in your hand.
There are other ways to serve, my lord.
I’m a prince now, and you’d do well…
There are other ways to serve, my prince.
Like what?
We know things, the free people.
You know things?
Like what?
How to eat dirt?
Other things.
Savage things.
Wait outside.
I always wondered what you had under there.
It comes at a price.
I’m not killing you.
That’s your price.
I already had that.
What do you want then, other than your miserable life?
What all free people want.
My freedom.
Well, you shall have it, then.
But only if you serve me well.
Ow!
Shh.
It’s not deep.
I thought they were going to kill me.
They thought so, too.
He hated me, the man who hit me.
I saw it in his eyes.
Hated me.
He never met me before, but he wanted to hurt me.
Of course he did.
Why?
Why would a stranger…
You are everything he will never have.
Your horse eats better than his children.
It doesn’t matter now.
He’s dead.
I would have given them bread if I had it.
I hate the king more than any of them.
Don’t say these things.
If the wrong people hear you…
But you’re not the wrong people.
Don’t trust anybody.
Life is safer that way.
And where are you going?
I have something for you from Prince Theon.
What?
Me.
He says I’m to make the rounds.
And keep you warm.
The Spice King refuses me because I’m a bad investment.
The Silk King won’t support me because of his business with the Lannisters.
Why offend his best customer?
And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night.
Does he think I will whore myself for a boat?
When I came to this city, I had nothing.
Truly nothing.
I slept by the docks.
And when I could find work loading the ships, I would eat.
If not, I dreamed of food.
Today, I am the richest man in Qarth.
Do you think the path from poverty to wealth is always pure and honourable?
I have done many things, Khaleesi, that a righteous man would condemn.
And here I am, with no regrets.
Bar the gates.
Ring the bells.
Slowly, Khaleesi.
Where are they?
Where are my dragons?To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
A cripple?
You let a cripple escape?
The boy can’t walk, but somehow he slipped past you?
The giant must have took him.
The giant?
Hodor?
Oh, that’s all right, then.
You let a halfwit escape with a cripple.
And Rickon, too?
The little one?
Gone, along with the wildling woman.
The one you were fucking.
Right.
Get the horses and the hounds.
Come on, find the scent.
Where they going?
Halt!
Enjoying your first hunt?
So far, hunting seems very similar to riding, my lord.
With hunting, there’s blood at the end.
They’re little boys.
I was a little boy when I was torn away from my home and brought here.
So I kept my word.
I never ran away.
If I find them soon enough, I won’t hurt them.
Well, I’ll hurt them, but I won’t kill them.
Those boys are of far more value to you alive than dead.
They have no value to me missing.
Robb will have sent a force to retake Winterfell by now.
Robb’s in the Riverlands.
My sister’s in Deepwood Motte.
She’ll get here long before they do.
And Ned Stark always said men could hold Winterfell against ,.
We have a scent!
The hounds have the scent.
Come, Maester, don’t look so grim.
It’s all just a game.
We should have took more food.
We couldn’t risk going to the kitchens.
Those people all love you.
They would have given you whatever you needed.
And if Theon found out, he’d hang them.
The boy can’t survive on walnuts.
I’m fine.
We’ve been walking since before sunrise.
Even Hodor will tire.
Hodor.
Even you, sweet giant.
Hodor.
Wait, I know that farm.
I sent those two Winterfell orphans there.
Jack and Billy.
They’ll give us some food.
We can’t risk it.
If Theon tracks us here, he’ll torture them until he finds out where we are.
Billy climbs a tree better than anyone.
You’ve never seen me climb a tree, little man.
They’ll be after us with hounds.
We got a good start on them, but we can’t outrun hounds forever.
Did you pull a knife on me in the night?
What’s the matter?
Can’t be the first time you pressed your bone against a woman’s arse.
Let’s move.
It is the first time.
How old are you, boy?
I’m a man of the Night’s Watch.
You’re a boy who’s never been with a girl.
Don’t your stones start to hurt if your bone never gets…
Don’t call them that.
What, stones?
Or bone?
Neither.
Both.
Move!
I heard they get all swollen and bruised if you don’t use them.
Of course, maybe that’s just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them.
As if I’d feel sorry for them.
Are there no girl crows?
There are no women of the Night’s Watch, no.
So the lads just do it with each other?
No.
Never?
Never.
We swore an oath.
You have sheep at the Wall?
With your hands, then?
No wonder you’re all so miserable.
Would you please shut up?
Would you please shut up?
You think you’re better than me, crow.
I’m a free woman.
You’re a free woman?
I might be your prisoner, but I’m a free woman.
If you’re my prisoner, you’re not a free woman.
That’s what “prisoner” means.
And you think you’re free?
You swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl.
It was my choice to say the words.
So you don’t like girls?
Of course I like girls.
But you chose never to touch them.
That’s the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night’s Watch.
So instead of getting naked with a girl, you’d prefer to invade our lands…
Invade your lands?
Wildlings raid our lands all the time.
Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy!
They’re not your lands!
We’ve been here the whole time.
You lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours.
My father was Ned Stark.
I have the blood of the First Men.
My ancestors lived here, same as yours.
So why are you fighting us?
Go on.
Now I want you to tell me what happened.
Come on, this way.
Come on, speak up.
Speak up.
Wolfsbane.
A rare substance.
This is no common assassin.
We hanged men last night.
I don’t care if you hanged .
A man tried to kill me.
I want his name and I want his head.
We think it was an infiltrator from the Brotherhood Without Banners.
Pretentious name for a band of outlaws.
We can’t allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity.
We look like fools and they look like heroes.
That’s how kings fall.
I want them dead, every one.
Killing them isn’t the problem.
It’s finding them.
Have you gone soft, Clegane?
I always thought you had a talent for violence.
Burn the villages, burn the farms.
Let them know what it means to choose the wrong side.
Mmm.
Is that mutton?
Yes, my lord.
Don’t like mutton.
I’ll bring something else.
Leave it.
Are you hungry?
No.
Of course you are.
Eat.
I’ll eat in the kitchen later.
It’s bad manners to refuse a lord’s offer.
Sit.
Eat.
You’re small for your age.
I suppose you’ve been underfed your whole life.
I eat a lot.
I just don’t grow.
Mmm.
This will be my last war.
Win or lose.
Have you ever lost before?
Do you think I’d be in my position if I had lost a war?
But this is the one I’ll be remembered for.
The War of Five Kings, they’re calling it.
My legacy will be determined in the coming months.
Do you know what legacy means?
It’s what you pass down to your children and your children’s children.
It’s what remains of you when you’re gone.
Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy.
The greatest fortress ever built.
The tallest towers, the strongest walls.
The Great Hall had hearths.
Thirtyfive.
Can you imagine?
Look at it now.
A blasted ruin.
Do you know what happened?
Dragons?
Yes.
Dragons happened.
Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land.
A million men could have marched on these walls, and a million men would have been repelled.
But an attack from the air with dragon fire…
Mmmmmm.
Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls.
Aegon Targaryen changed the rules.
That’s why every child alive still knows his name years after his death.
Aegon and his sisters.
Mmm?
It wasn’t just Aegon riding his dragon.
It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too.
Correct.
A student of history, are you?
Rhaenys rode Meraxes.
Visenya rode Vhagar.
I’m sure I knew that when I was a boy.
Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior.
She had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister.
Hmm.
She’s a heroine of yours, I take it?
Aren’t most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs?
Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?
Most girls are idiots.
You remind me of my daughter.
Where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?
From my father.
He was a wellread stonemason.
Can’t say I’ve ever met a literate stonemason.
Have you met many stonemasons, my lord?
Careful now, girl.
I enjoy you, but be careful.
Take that back to the kitchen.
Eat what you want.
And, girl.
“M’lord.
” Lowborn girls say “m’lord,” not “my lord.
” If you’re going to pose as a commoner, you should do it properly.
My mother served Lady Dustin for many years, my lord.
She taught me how to speak proper…
Properly.
You’re too smart for your own good.
Has anyone told you that?
Yes.
Go on.
I beg pardon, ser.
I should have come to you after to thank you for saving me.
You were so brave.
Brave?
A dog doesn’t need courage to chase off rats.
Does it give you joy to scare people?
No, it gives me joy to kill people.
Spare me.
You can’t tell me Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell never killed a man.
It was his duty.
He never liked it.
Is that what he told you?
He lied.
Killing is the sweetest thing there is.
Why are you always so hateful?
You’ll be glad of the hateful things I do someday when you’re queen and I’m all that stands between you and your beloved king.
I’ve demanded a meeting of the Thirteen.
One of them did this or knows who did.
You are one of the Thirteen.
If I wanted your dragons, I would have taken them.
They mean nothing to me on their own.
Nothing?
They’re more valuable than anything in the world.
Shall we look inside my vault and see what selling your dragons would buy me I cannot buy already?
We will get them back.
There is no we, so why would you help me get them back?
I took you under my protection in front of the rulers of my city.
A man is what others say he is and no more.
If they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar, my word is worth nothing.
I cannot let this thing happen to you under my roof.
But it did happen under your roof.
Khaleesi, many times in my life, I have been…
I don’t care where you’ve been.
You think we’re savages because we don’t live in stone castles.
We can’t make steel as good as yours, it’s true, but…
We’re free.
If someone tried to tell us we couldn’t lie down as man and woman, we’d shove a spear up his arse.
We don’t go serving some shit king who’s only king because his father was.
No.
No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall.
We chose Mance Rayder to lead us.
He was a crow, same as you, but he wanted to be free.
You could be free, too.
You don’t need to live your whole life taking commands from old men.
Wake up when you want to wake up.
I could show you the streams to fish, the woods to hunt.
Build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night.
You’re a pretty lad.
The girls would claw each other’s eyes out to get naked with you.
Walk.
I could teach you how to do it.
I know how to do it.
You know nothing, Jon Snow.
And what did she say?
She admired your spirit, Your Grace.
And what then?
She…
If every man were held accountable for the actions of every distant relative, Ser Alton, we’d all hang.
She tore the paper in half, Your Grace.
You’ve acted with honour.
I thank you for it.
Lord Karstark, see that Ser Alton’s pen is clean, and give him a hot supper.
Ser Alton’s pen is occupied, Your Grace.
The prisoners from the Yellow Fork.
Too many prisoners.
Is there room for Ser Alton?
Does he need to lie down?
Have the men build him a new pen.
Put him in with the Kingslayer for now.
Have your boy watch over them.
Torrhen.
That will be all.
Your Grace.
A minute of your time?
I’ve been treating your wounded men.
And my enemies, as some of my bannermen are fond of mentioning.
They’re not my enemies.
That’s what I tell my bannermen.
I’ve already run through the supplies I brought with me.
Some are easily replaced.
Egg yolks, turpentine, oil of roses.
But some are not.
I need silk for stitching.
I need fennel root for those with fever, willow bark.
Mostly I need milk of the poppy.
You saw what it was like to amputate a foot without any.
I assume there will be more loss of limb before this war is over.
If you need help finding these…
I know where to find them.
I’m sorry, I shouldn’t interrupt you.
Continue, my lady.
You’re riding to the Crag to negotiate a surrender?
Yes.
The Crag will have a maester and he will have what I need.
I expect he will.
If I could write a list.
Come with me to the Crag.
I don’t think that will be…
Let the maester show you his stores.
I want the wounded men to be treated well, all the wounded men.
Children, come inside, quick.
Come on.
Hurry up!
Can’t find anything, ser.
They’ve lost the scent.
Try again.
We’ve circled this farmhouse twice.
There’s no sign of them.
We could start the search fresh in the morning, my lord.
I’m looking at spending the rest of my life being treated like a fool and a eunuch by my own people.
Ask yourself, is there anything I wouldn’t do to stop that from happening?
The hounds will find the scent again.
I’ll beat them until they do.
I’ll whip every man here until I have both those boys in hand.
And once I’ve got them, the pampered little shits…
It’s better to be cruel than weak.
Prince Theon.
Where are they?
Who, m’lord?
The Stark boys.
Where are they?
I don’t know.
I seen no one.
Think harder.
I swear, m’lord.
I don’t know.
My lord, over here.
I think I’ve found what we’re looking for.
Send the old man home.
Go back to Winterfell.
Take him back.
Theon, don’t do this.
You came back.
As soon as I heard.
Do you know anything?
Irri is dead.
I know.
She was a good…
She’s dead.
She died alone.
She died for me and I couldn’t protect her.
Doreah?
We can’t find her.
She must be dead, too.
I led my people out of the Red Waste and into the slaughterhouse.
I should have been here.
You went to find me a ship.
My place is by your side.
I shouldn’t have left you alone with these people.
“These people”?
They are not to be trusted.
And who is to be trusted?
Who are my people?
The Targaryens?
I only knew one, my brother, and he would have let a thousand men rape me if it had got him the crown.
The Dothraki?
Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse.
Your people are in Westeros.
The people in Westeros don’t know I’m alive.
They will soon enough.
And then what?
They’ll pray for my return?
They’ll wave dragon banners and shout my name?
That’s what my brother believed and he was a fool.
You are not your brother.
Trust me, Khaleesi.
There it is.
“Trust me.
” And it’s you I should trust, Ser Jorah?
Only you?
I don’t need trust any longer.
I don’t want it and I don’t have room for it.
You are too young to be so…
And you are too familiar.
Forgive me, Khaleesi.
No one can survive in this world without help.
No one.
Let me help you, please.
Tell me how.
Find my dragons.
How long till we get back to your crows?
We’re close.
What, a day?
A halfday?
You don’t know, do you?
Do you even know where they are?
We’re close.
What do you think they’ll say when they hear about you and me?
Nothing happened between you and me.
“I swear it, Old Master King Crow, ser, “we were only close together for warmth.
“And then I felt it, right up against me backside like a club.
“I can show you the bruise on me tailbone.
“And before I knew what was where, his…
his…
“Well, it was all out in the open, all angry as you like.
“And I didn’t want to want it, but oh, I did!
“And he spread me legs and ruined.
“The shame of it.
“Now I can never marry a perfumed lord.
“What will me poor savage father say?
” Turn back around.
“And I thought that we were done, but he said, “‘Turn back around.
“‘ I’ll tell you what, Jon Snow.
Since it’s gonna be your word against mine, and since you can’t talk about it without blushing, we may as well just…
What, right here in the muck?
I’ll keep you warm enough.
Are you that afraid of it?
That’s enough.
It’s nice and wet and warm.
Enough!
It don’t have teeth.
All right!
All right.
Gods, you’re dull.
Should have took me while you had the chance.
No, no!
No.
Oh, no.
It’s all right.
Give me that.
If the queen sees, I can have Joffrey’s children now.
Help me flip it over.
Where are you going?
To tell Her Grace.
You’ll say nothing to anyone.
Do you understand?
Your mother might have prepared you.
You flowered, my dear.
No more.
My mother told me, but I thought it would be different.
In what way?
I thought it would be less…
Less messy.
Wait until you birth a child.
You’re a woman now.
Do you have any idea what that means?
I’m fit to bear children for the king?
A prospect that once delighted you, bringing little princes and princesses into the world, the greatest honour for a queen.
Joffrey has always been difficult.
Even his birth, I laboured a day and a half to bring him into this world.
You cannot imagine the pain.
I screamed so loudly, I was sure Robert would hear me in the Kingswood.
His Grace was not with you?
Robert was hunting.
That was his custom.
Whenever my time was near, my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and his hounds.
And when he returned, he would present me with some pelts or a stag’s head, and I would present him with a baby.
Not that I wanted him there, mind you.
I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother.
When they told Jaime he wasn’t allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out.
Joffrey will show you no such devotion.
You may never love the king, but you will love his children.
I love His Grace with all my heart.
That’s so very touching to hear.
Permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this very special day.
The more people you love, the weaker you are.
You’ll do things for them that you know you shouldn’t do.
You’ll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe.
Love no one but your children.
On that front, a mother has no choice.
But shouldn’t I love Joffrey, Your Grace?
You can try, little dove.
Who did you say your mother was again?
Cinda Lannister.
Is she the fat one?
Well, perhaps she’s gotten a little larger than she…
No, no.
There’s only one fat Lannister.
If she was your mother, you’d know it.
I squired for you once, you know.
When?
The tournament, the day of Willem Frey’s wedding.
I went to Willem Frey’s wedding?
You did.
Your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he threw up.
He threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds.
What was his name?
Bryan.
Poor lad.
That was my brother’s doing, I seem to recall.
I remember you.
You’d never squired for anyone before.
That’s right.
I ran up and volunteered.
“Let me, my lord.
Let me.
” My father was furious.
Afraid I’d embarrass our family in front of the Family.
You didn’t, though.
You really remember?
You knew when you were needed and when to go away.
It’s a rare talent.
Most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them.
When I think back to that day…
Shh!
You were saying?
I…
Never mind.
It’s embarrassing.
More embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit?
I remember everything about that day, your helmet, your horse, the rake lines in the dirt along the list, where the sun was in the sky when you knocked Balon Swann from his horse, and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me.
I’ll remember it all until I die.
That was the best day of my life.
And I remember being on the field after it was over.
All the competitors were done.
I was the last one out there.
And I couldn’t leave.
I couldn’t bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride.
And I couldn’t bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you, when I knew that they could never have the faintest idea what I was talking about.
I understand completely.
How could you?
Sorry, I…
I didn’t mean to doubt you.
It’s just that I…
I was once.
I also had to replace someone’s squire on short notice.
Which knight was it?
Barristan Selmy.
The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws.
Before your time.
What was he like?
He was…
A painter.
A painter who only used red.
I couldn’t imagine being able to fight like that, not back then.
And to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect.
I don’t need to explain how that felt, not to you.
It’s hard to put into words.
It’s like stepping into a dream you’ve been dreaming for as long as you can remember, and finding out that the dream is more real than your life.
Leaving that battlefield was like being dragged off to prison.
Did you squire for him again?
No.
I didn’t have your gift.
He couldn’t take a step without stepping on me.
I was awful, a complete liability.
Until one of the outlaws decided to take on a yearold squire.
It’s a good thing I am who I am.
I’d have been useless at anything else.
I’m not wellsuited for imprisonment.
Shocking, I know.
Some men are.
Ned Stark, I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end.
Not me, though.
My life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint.
And have you thought about…
Of course.
Every day.
And?
Good prisoners breed good jailers, apparently.
The Starks are very careful.
But there is a way, I think.
It wasn’t possible until now.
What is it?
It’s actually quite simple.
Well, let me help you.
You’ll only have to do one thing.
Tell me.
You’ll have to die.
Jorah the Andal.
This man must sail past old Valyria.
All who travel too close to the doom must have protection.
I didn’t come here for lessons.
No, you came for the dragons.
You have them?
Where are they?
Draw your sword.
See what your steel is worth.
You want to please the Mother of Dragons.
You love her.
Where are the dragons?
Will you betray her again, Jorah the Andal?
Will you betray her again?
Never.
The thief you seek is with her now.
I did not leave the comfort of my home to come to yours and be called a thief.
No one is calling you a thief.
Who is she to accuse us?
Please, they’re my children.
I’m begging you.
Begging us?
It wasn’t very long ago you were threatening us.
Without me, the dragons will die.
It will be for the best.
Your dragons will bring the world nothing but death and misery, my dear.
If I knew where they were, I would not tell you.
You are cruel, my friend.
The Mother of Dragons is in the right.
She must be reunited with her babies.
I will help you, Khaleesi.
How?
I will take you to the House of the Undying where I have put them.
You have my dragons?
When I learned you were coming to our city, I made an arrangement with the King of Qarth.
He procured them for me.
But there is no King of Qarth.
There is now.
That was the other half of the arrangement.
You would keep your gates and your minds closed to everything outside your walls, but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was if it refuses to change.
I will open Qarth to the world as I have forced it to open itself to me.
Your ambition is an inspiration.
But like all upstarts, you overreach.
Three dragons the size of cats and an alliance with a charlatan do not make you a king.
An upstart and a charlatan?
Empires have been built by less.
Those on the margins often come to control the centre, and those in the centre make room for them, willingly or otherwise.
The Mother of Dragons will be with her babies.
She will give them her love and they will thrive by her side, forever.
A mother should be with her children.
Where will you run to, Daenerys Stormborn?
Your dragons wait for you in the House of the Undying.
Come see them.
Lady Stark!
No farther.
Keep your hands off me, woman.
Don’t enter without an invitation, man.
Forgive me.
Lady Stark.
What is it?
They caught the Kingslayer.
Kingslayer!
Kill the fucking Kingslayer!
Hang him!
Hang him!
You’ll die today.
Justice for the Karstark.
Gut him!
Get back!
I want his head!
Any man who stands between a father and his vengeance asks for death.
Lord Karstark, this man is our prisoner.
This monster killed my son.
And crippled mine.
He will answer for his crimes, I promise you, but not here.
I will have his head.
And if you try and stop me…
You will strike me down?
Have you forgotten me, ser?
I am the widow of your liege, Lord Eddard Stark.
I am the mother of your king!
And where is our king now?
You know very well.
He has gone to the Crag to accept the surrender.
Aye, gone to the Crag, but not to negotiate.
He brought that foreign bitch with him.
How dare you!
Threatening my lady is an act of treason.
Treason?
How can it be treason to kill Lannisters?
I understand your grief, my lord, better than most, I understand it.
But in the name of my son, the King in the North, stand down.
When your son returns, I will demand this murderer’s head.
Wise men do not make demands of kings.
Fathers who love their sons do.
I will have his head.
Thank you for fighting on my behalf, Lady Stark.
I would have come to your defence, but…
Take him to the stockades.
Bind him with every chain you can find!
You’ve become a real shewolf in your later years.
There’s not much fish left in you.
And gag him!
Since when do you light your own candles?
Since I decided that I can’t stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant.
How many times can you read one raven scroll?
Stannis Baratheon’s fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth, ships.
More than we have.
Yes, that’s more than we have.
He’ll be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind.
We have strong, high walls.
We’ll rain fire down on them from above.
“Rain fire on them from above.
” You’re quoting Father, aren’t you?
Why not?
He has a good mind for strategy, doesn’t he?
Call it tactics, not strategy.
But, yes, he does have a good mind for it.
The best mind, some would say.
Sadly, he’s not here.
It’s just you, me and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
I’m sure you’ll make a point eventually.
He needs to start acting like a king.
This war you started is coming to our doorstep.
And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead…
I’m not the one giving the boy whores to abuse.
I thought the girls might help him.
Did you?
I was wrong.
If we can’t control him…
Do you think I haven’t tried?
He doesn’t listen to me.
It’s hard to put a leash on a dog once you’ve put a crown on its head.
I always hoped he’d be like Jaime.
He looks like him.
In a certain light.
The boy is more Robert than Jaime.
Robert was a drunken fool, but he didn’t enjoy cruelty.
Sometimes I wonder.
What?
If this is the price for what we’ve done, for our sins.
Sins?
The Targaryens…
Wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know.
That’s what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt.
It’s what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me.
Half the Targaryens went mad, didn’t they?
What’s the saying?
“Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin.
” You’ve beaten the odds.
Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them.
Then why wait?
We’re sworn to the king.
There’s not a king.
That’s treason.
So is saving Lannisters, yeah?
Back off, you.
No, I won’t.
Your son returns at dawn, my lady?
So they say.
The Kingslayer won’t last the night.
The more they drink, the angrier they’ll get.
And when the Karstarks draw their swords…
Who wants to die defending a Lannister?
Come.
He’ll not be making it through the night.
I need to be alone with him.
My lady, our orders…
Your orders, which I just gave you, are to leave me alone with him.
Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark?
I believe it’s my last night in this world.
Is that a woman?
Do you hear them out there?
They want your head.
Old Lord Karstark doesn’t seem to like me.
You strangled his son with your chains.
Oh.
Oh.
Was he the one on guard duty?
He was in my way.
Any knight would have done the same.
You are no knight.
You have forsaken every vow you ever took.
So many vows.
They make you swear and swear.
Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak.
But what if your father despises the king?
What if the king massacres the innocent?
It’s too much.
No matter what you do, you’re forsaking one vow or another.
Where did you find this beast?
She is a truer knight than you will ever be, Kingslayer.
Kingslayer.
What a king he was.
Here’s to Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, and to the sword I shoved in his back.
You are a man without honour.
Do you know, I’ve never been with any woman but Cersei.
So in my own way, I have more honour than poor old dead Ned.
What was the name of that bastard he fathered?
Brienne.
No, that wasn’t it.
Snow, a bastard from the North.
Now, when…
When good old Ned came home with some whore’s baby, did you pretend to love it?
No.
You’re not very good at pretending.
You’re an honest woman.
You hated that boy, didn’t you?
How could you not hate him?
The walking, talking reminder that the honourable Lord Eddard Stark fucked another woman.
Your sword.
I told you what would happen.
All of you.
I told you what would happen if you served me loyally.
And what would happen if you did not.
What are you doing?
What have you done?
If there are any who still question whether your new lord means what he says, here is the answer to your question.
No!To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
Riders approaching!
Open the gate!
Why, it’s the Prince of Winterfell.
Envy isn’t attractive.
What envy?
You should be proud of your brother’s achievement.
I took the great castle of Winterfell with men.
You’re a great warrior.
I saw the bodies above your gates.
Which one gave you the tougher fight, the cripple or the sixyearold?
I treated the Stark boys with honour, and they repaid me with treachery.
You treated them with honour?
By butchering them?
Before I had to kill them, I treated them…
You seized their home, as is your right.
We’re ironborn, we take what we need.
Exactly.
Then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away.
Is that treachery?
I’d call it bravery.
They made me a promise…
Your little boy prisoners made you a promise and you got mad when they broke it?
Are you the dumbest cunt alive?
Don’t call me…
A cunt.
A dumb cunt who killed the only two Starks in Winterfell.
You know how valuable those boys were?
If I hadn’t killed them, the Northerners would think me weak.
You are weak.
And you’re stupid.
I’m warning you.
Go on, then.
Warn me.
You haven’t brought enough men.
How am I supposed to defend Winterfell with just this lot?
You’re not.
I’ve come to bring you home.
Father wants a word.
Is this a joke?
Winterfell is the heart of the North.
Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea.
We’re islanders, baby brother.
Had you forgotten that?
Our power comes from our ships.
And now that you’ve decorated your walls with the bodies of the Stark boys, every man in the North wants to see you hanged.
When Robb Stark finds out…
He won’t find out.
We’ve killed all the ravens.
We have all the horses.
I’ve taken Winterfell.
And I will keep Winterfell.
Leave us.
Theon, you’re my blood.
We both loved our mother.
We both endured our father.
Come home with me.
Don’t die here alone.
I don’t intend to die.
You were a terrible baby, do you know that?
Bawling all the time, never sleeping.
And one night, you just wouldn’t shut up, screaming like a dying pig.
I walked over to your crib, I looked down at you.
I wanted to strangle you.
And you looked up at me and you stopped screaming.
You smiled at me.
Don’t die so far from the sea.
I’ve brought you a present, Lord of Bones.
I already got one crow.
Don’t need two.
Mance will want to question this one.
Knows all about where the crows are and what they’re planning.
The Halfhand knows more.
This one is just a little boy.
Gut him.
He could have killed me half a dozen times.
And now he wishes he did.
Gut him.
He’s a bastard of Winterfell, Ned Stark’s son.
Mance will want him.
What does Mance want with a dead man’s bastard?
I don’t know.
I think he’ll want to decide for himself.
He runs, I’ll chop his balls off.
He runs, I’ll do it meself.
We’re even now, Jon Snow.
I couldn’t do it.
I had the sword on her neck, I just couldn’t…
I know.
The others?
When you didn’t come back, we went looking for you.
We found your tracks fast enough.
But they found us before we found you.
They died because of me.
See that it wasn’t for nothing.
All right, up, lad.
Come on, on your feet, now.
Move it.
Is she beautiful?
I’ve never met her.
What’s her name?
Frey, I suppose.
I don’t know her first name.
I’m sure you’ll be very happy.
And you’re marrying her for a bridge?
An important bridge.
Ah.
It was before they killed my father.
I still thought I could march south and rescue him in time, but only if I crossed that bridge.
When I speak to people from the North, they all loved your father.
He was the best man I ever met.
I know children always think that about their fathers, but…
Children do not always think that about their fathers, believe me.
He once told me that being a lord is like being a father, except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them.
The farmers ploughing the fields are yours to protect.
The charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect.
The soldiers you order into battle.
He told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night.
I didn’t believe him.
I asked him, “How can a man be brave if he’s afraid?
” “That is the only time a man can be brave,” he told me.
I wish I could have met him.
He would have liked you.
Most lords worry more about their gold and their glory than the charwomen scrubbing their floors.
He didn’t care much about gold or glory.
And you?
You think I’m fighting this war so they’ll sing songs about me?
I want to go home.
I want the men following me to go home.
Then why don’t you?
Because we’ll never be safe until the Lannisters are defeated.
And because I believe in justice.
Chopping off Joffrey’s head, you mean.
That would be a start.
Your Grace, milady.
The Kingslayer, he escaped in the night.
How?
How?
Tell me this isn’t true.
Why?
For the girls.
You betrayed me.
Robb…
No!
You knew I would not allow it and you did it anyway.
Bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell.
Sansa and Arya are captives in King’s Landing.
I have five children, and only one of them is free.
I lost one son fighting by your son’s side.
I lost another to the Kingslayer, strangled with a chain.
You commit treason because your children are prisoners?
I would carve out my heart and offer it to the Father, if he would let my sons wake from their graves and step into a prison cell.
I grieve for your sons, my lord.
I don’t want your grief.
I want my vengeance.
And you stole it from me.
Killing Jaime Lannister would not buy life for your children, but returning him to King’s Landing may buy life for mine.
Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool.
You’ve weakened our position.
You’ve brought discord into our camp.
And you did it all behind my back.
Make sure she’s guarded day and night.
Robb.
How many men did we send in pursuit of the Kingslayer?
Forty, Your Grace.
Send another with our fastest horses.
Robb.
Damn.
You’re much uglier in daylight.
What’s your name?
I’m Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock, son of Tywin.
A captive knight has a right to know his captor’s identity.
Brienne of Tarth.
Tarth, Tarth, Tarth.
Crescent moons and starbursts.
Lord…
Selwyn Tarth.
Your father.
Do you have any brothers and sisters, my lady?
It’s a long way to King’s Landing.
Might as well get to know one another.
Have you known many men?
I suppose not.
Women?
Horses?
Ah.
I didn’t mean to give offence, my lady.
Forgive me.
Your crimes are past forgiveness, Kingslayer.
Why do you hate me so much?
Have I ever harmed you?
You’ve harmed others, those you were sworn to protect, the weak, the innocent.
Has anyone ever told you you’re as boring as you are ugly?
You will not provoke me to anger.
I already have.
Look at you.
You’re ready to chop my head off.
Do you think you could?
Do you think you could beat me in a fair fight?
I’ve never seen you fight.
The answer is no.
There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me.
You’re not one of them.
All my life men like you have sneered at me.
And all my life I’ve been knocking men like you into the dust.
If you’re so confident, unlock my chains.
Let’s see what happens.
Do you take me for an idiot?
In!
I took you for a fighter, a man…
Pardon.
Woman of honour.
Was I wrong?
You’re afraid.
Maybe one day we’ll find out, Kingslayer.
King’s Landing will fall an hour after Stannis lands his force.
It’s not too late for King Joffrey and Cersei and the court to ride west to safety.
Surrender the Iron Throne?
Better than seeing their heads mounted on the city gates.
Stannis will execute them all.
No, a king who runs will not be king for long.
He’s a Lannister.
He’ll stand and fight.
Stannis, two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep.
The scouts assure us Robb Stark remains north of Ashemark.
Ha!
The last time the scouts assured us of Stark’s movement, he lured us into a trap.
Which is why my son is his prisoner.
Too close to Casterly Rock.
He sent a splinter force to recapture Winterfell.
The Greyjoys have done us a great favour.
Stark won’t risk marching on Casterly Rock until he’s at full force.
He’s a boy and he’s never lost a battle.
He’ll risk anything at any time because he doesn’t know enough to be afraid.
We’ll ride at nightfall.
I want a full night’s march before he knows we’re on the move.
Clegane, you’ll maintain a garrison here at Harrenhal.
Track down this brotherhood and destroy them.
The girl has proven herself a good servant.
She’ll stay on with you.
See that he doesn’t get drunk in the evenings.
He’s poor company when he’s sober, but he’s better at his work.
You’ve got some questions to answer.
Who killed Ser Amory?
I don’t know!
Please!
Give me the name.
Take this one out for the crows.
I told you, I don’t know.
Please.
Look, it’s Yoren’s little cunt.
Used to be a boy, now it’s a girl.
Where’s Jaqen?
Don’t care.
Where’s your stick now, bitch?
I promised to fuck you with it.
Come on, time to kill some wolves.
You need sour cherries to make it right.
And the secret is you dry the stones, and then you break them with a mallet.
That’s where the real flavour is.
You crush ’em up real fine.
And then when you’re finished, you sprinkle them over the piecrust.
Where’s Jaqen?
How would I know?
I need him now.
Lord Tywin’s marching tonight.
You need him?
He’s helping me.
I saw him.
Where?
Where?
Where?
Ow!
They went riding out the gates a few hours ago.
On patrol.
Let go of my ears.
What do you want with him anyway?
Mance is gonna march on the Wall.
When he does, one brother inside his army will be worth , fighting against it.
They’ll never trust me.
They might.
If you do what needs to be done.
What?
How does it feel knowing those men all died so you could skip through the snow with your little savage girl?
I didn’t.
I should have known better, trusting a traitor’s bastard.
He’s not yours to kill, crow.
Do you have to do that here?
I like to keep me hands clean.
Yes, but do you have to do it here?
You should start wearing the gold cloak.
I don’t want to wear a gold cloak.
You’re commander of the City Watch.
You shouldn’t be dressed like a common…
A cloak slows you down in a fight.
Makes it hard to move quietly.
And the gold catches the light, so you’re nice and easy to spot at night.
Well, you’re not sneaking through alleyways any longer.
You’re supposed to stand out.
We had a deal and wearing a gold cloak wasn’t part of it.
Fine, fine.
No gold cloak.
What?
What?
What?
What?
Why are you staring at me?
You don’t want me cleaning me nails.
You don’t want me looking your way.
Why am I here?
To help me plan the defence of King’s Landing.
Stannis will be here any day.
And one of these explains how to beat him?
“An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros.
” By Archmaester Shevelathin.
Shevelatesh.
Chevalteesh.
I’d swap all your books for a few good archers.
My Lord Hand.
Commander.
I must compliment you on the gold cloaks’ performance these last few weeks.
Did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery?
I did not know.
And how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery?
Me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves.
For questioning?
No.
It’s just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now.
We talked about this.
Aye, we talked about it.
Have you ever been in a city under siege?
Maybe this part’s not in your books.
See, it’s not the fighting that kills most people.
It’s the starving.
Food’s worth more than gold.
Noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes.
Things get bad enough, the poor start eating each other.
The thieves, they love a siege.
Soon as the gates are sealed, they steal all the food.
By the time it’s all over, they’re the richest men in town.
Given the circumstances, my lord, I believe extreme measures are warranted.
Ah.
“The Great Sieges of Westeros.
” Thrilling subject.
Shame Archmaester Ch’Vyalthan wasn’t a better writer.
Stannis knows King’s Landing.
He knows where the walls are strongest, and he knows which gates are weakest.
The Mud Gate.
A good ram will batter it down in minutes, and it’s only yards from the water.
That’s where he’ll land.
And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate, what is our plan?
We could throw books at his men.
We don’t have that many books.
We don’t have that many men, either.
What do we have?
Pig shit.
I’m not cut out for this sort of work.
I always imagined meself doing something much worse.
We’re digging latrine pits at the end of the world.
I can’t imagine anything much worse.
You lack imagination.
Where do you think Jon is right now?
He went off with the Halfhand.
He didn’t come back.
A betting man would go with dead.
He’s not dead.
No, Jon’s a great fighter.
Well, he’s better than me and a lot better than you.
He’s got a Valyrian steel sword.
So did his father.
And Qhorin Halfhand is the greatest ranger alive.
Great rangers never get old is the problem.
Shit ones neither.
It’s them in the middle that last a long time.
What in seven hells is that?
The First Men made these marks.
Help me with it.
Look.
If you find something you’re not supposed to, best thing to do is pretend you’ve never seen it.
That’s a Night’s Watch cloak.
It’s been here a long time.
Oh.
Must be dragonglass.
Dragonglass?
The maesters call it obsidian.
Why would a brother hide it here?
I expect it’s ’cause he wanted somebody to find it.
Mind where you’re going.
I’m sorry.
I’ll…
Where were you?
A man has patrol duty.
Tywin Lannister was right here, and now he’s gone.
A girl owes one more name.
The Red God demands it.
Give the man a name.
How long after I give you the name does it take you to kill someone?
A minute, an hour, a month.
Death is certain, the time is not.
He’s taking his army to attack my brother.
I need him dead right now.
This a man cannot do.
You promised you’d help me.
Help was not promised, lovely girl.
Only death.
There must be others.
Give a name, any name.
And you’ll kill them?
Anybody?
By the Seven New Gods and the Old Gods beyond counting, I swear it.
All right.
Jaqen H’ghar.
A girl gives a man his own name?
That’s right.
Gods are not mocked.
This is no joking thing.
I’m not joking.
A man can go kill himself.
Unname me.
No.
Please?
I’ll unname you.
Thank you.
If you help me and my friends escape.
This would require more than one life.
This is not part of our bargain.
Fine, Jaqen H’ghar.
A girl lacks honour.
If I do this thing, a girl must obey.
A girl will obey.
A girl and her friends will walk through the gate at midnight.
Thank you, Podrick.
Odd little boy.
I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.
You and Varys both.
Excellent lamprey pie.
Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day?
I hear Joffrey plans on fighting.
An inspiration for the troops.
The young king in his shining armour fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel.
He’s only a boy.
Younger boys are off fighting his war.
He’s not ready.
What is he, ?
Remember Jaime at ?
Better than you.
Some men have a gift for this sort of thing, some don’t.
His place is not on the battlefield.
It’s not on the throne, either, sadly for all of us.
Do you think I’m an idiot?
No, I’d say you possess aboveaverage intelligence.
You shipped off my only daughter.
And now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die.
He’ll have his Kingsguard protecting him.
He has the finest armour gold can buy.
He needs to be out there.
The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother’s skirts.
Any dessert?
Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?
Because he has thousands of spies in his employ.
Because he knows everything we do before we do it.
Because he doesn’t have a cock.
Neither do you.
Perhaps I’m dangerous, too.
You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man.
That little worm between your legs does half your thinking.
It’s not that little.
Why are you smiling?
Because I’m happy.
And why are you happy?
Because I have your little whore.
I thought you preferred blondes.
Such a droll little fellow.
Tell me, have you married this one yet?
No?
Good.
Father will be so pleased.
Why do you care who I fuck?
Because a Lannister always pays her debts.
You stole my only daughter, you plot to have Joffrey killed.
This is madness.
Stannis will be here in days.
You need me.
For what?
Your skill in battle?
Pretty thing, your whore.
Lovely body.
The bruises will heal in time.
Where did you find her?
Varys isn’t the only one who hears whispers.
Really, a Lannister lion necklace?
You need to hide your secret whores more carefully.
You’ve forgotten the most important thing about whores.
Oh?
Well, you’re the expert.
Tell me.
You don’t buy them, you only rent them.
You’re usually a better liar, baby brother.
This one you like.
You like her very much.
Could it be love?
Don’t worry, she’ll be treated gently enough.
Unless Joffrey is hurt.
And then every wound he suffers, she’ll suffer, too.
And if he dies, there isn’t a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt.
And how do I know you haven’t killed her already?
Would you like to see her?
I thought you might.
Ser Mandon, bring in my brother’s whore.
I’m sorry they hurt you.
You must be brave.
I promise I will free you.
Don’t forget me.
Never.
I will hurt you for this.
A day will come when you think you’re safe and happy, and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth.
And you will know the debt is paid.
Get out.
Shae!
I’ve been waiting all night.
What is wrong?
You’re beautiful.
Then why do you look sad?
We have to be more careful.
Don’t be afraid.
I can take care of myself.
There are people who want to hurt me.
I know.
I won’t let them.
I’ll cut off their faces.
I will.
I would kill for you.
Do you know that?
I expect I’ll have to before this is over.
You’re mine.
I’m yours.
Promise me.
I’m yours, and you are mine.
Still no word?
We’ve sent a dozen ravens.
None have returned.
My bastard is only a few days from Winterfell.
Once he captures the castle…
Theon has my brothers.
If we storm the castle…
He wouldn’t dare hurt the boys.
They’re his only hope of escaping the North with his head.
Send word to your son.
Any ironborn who surrender will be allowed to return safely to their homes.
A touch of mercy is a virtue, Your Grace.
Too much…
Any ironborn with the exception of Theon Greyjoy.
He betrayed our cause.
He betrayed me.
And we will hunt him down no matter where he runs.
I expect his countrymen will turn on him the minute they hear the offer.
Your pardon, my lord.
Your Grace.
My lady.
How are you?
How am I?
I’ve had to arrest my mother.
The Lannisters have my sisters.
The man I considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers.
I’m fighting a war and I don’t know if I should march south or north.
I’m sorry.
It was a stupid question.
I’m sorry.
No.
Forgive me.
You’re being kind.
I have no right.
You have every right.
You’re a king.
That’s not the kind of king I want to be.
What kind do you want to be?
I don’t know.
The good kind.
Most kings grew up as princes.
They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown.
I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.
I was raised to be a proper little lady, to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite Valyrian poetry.
I’d like to hear you play the harp.
No.
No, you would not.
How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry to sawing off men’s feet?
When I was , my mother and father went to a wedding.
Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know.
And they left me with my little brother.
The second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the threeyear summer.
We couldn’t bear to be inside, so we ran down to the Rhoyne.
Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day.
The rich, the poor, we were all there.
Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands.
Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank.
I was treading water, talking to a friend, when I realised I hadn’t seen my brother.
I called his name.
Then I started screaming his name.
And then I saw him…
floating face down.
My heart just…
stopped.
I was…
I dragged him from the water.
My friend helped me, I think.
I don’t even remember.
He was so little.
Then we pulled him onto the riverbank.
And I screamed at him and I shook him.
And he was dead.
Just dead.
A man ran over.
He had a fish tattoo on his face.
In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos.
So you know what they are without having to talk to them.
And this man worked on a fishing boat.
And he pushed me out of the way.
You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl, that’s death for the man, a terrible death.
But he pushed me out of the way, and he started pressing on my brother’s chest again and again and again, until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out.
And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm.
I decided two things that day.
I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies.
And when I came of age, I would never live in a slave city again.
I’m sorry, Your Grace.
You told me of your problems and I’ve blathered on.
I don’t want to marry the Frey girl.
I don’t want you to marry her.
But you needed that bridge.
I hope it’s a very beautiful bridge.
The sour cherries was all crushed up and ready.
Shut up.
Probably in the piecrust by now.
In the oven.
The nice, warm oven.
Shut up.
What did you bring?
The cheese could be better.
I did get some nice sausages.
What did he want us to do about those guards?
He didn’t say.
He just said, “Walk through the gates.
” What about the guards?
He didn’t say anything about the guards.
What, he left that bit out?
It’s a pretty important part, don’t you think?
We have to trust him.
Trust him?
You trusted him to fight with us when you set him free and he ran.
I want to go back to the kitchens.
Shut up.
Stay here if you’re afraid.
Arry, don’t.
Away!
Reset!
If the wind holds, we’ll reach King’s Landing in a day.
Will it hold?
Can’t make promises for the wind, Your Grace.
Again, pull!
I admire you, Ser Davos.
I thank you, Your Grace.
Pleased to hear it.
Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight and think they insult you.
So you take the onion for your sigil, sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag.
My son wishes me to change it.
Three mermen with tridents, something like that.
I understand why the older families look down at me.
Do you?
Why?
My father was a crabber.
And?
Well, sons of lords don’t like to break bread with sons of crabbers.
Our hands stink.
And where were those lords when Storm’s End starved?
Many fought bravely for your brother.
Many fought for the Mad King.
You defend these men who insult you behind your back.
Some are happy to do it to my face.
We were forgotten.
Robert and Ned Stark, they were the heroes.
The glorious rebels marching from battle to battle, liberating towns from the yoke of the Mad King, while I held Storm’s End with men.
No one has forgotten, Your Grace.
No?
Robert did.
He gave Storm’s End to Renly after the war.
Renly never fought a day in his life.
He was only a boy.
Then why’d he give him Storm’s End?
First, we ate the horses.
We weren’t riding anywhere, not with the castle surrounded.
We couldn’t feed them, so fine, the horses.
Then the cats.
Never liked cats.
So fine.
I do like dogs.
Good animals.
Loyal.
But we ate them.
Then the rats.
The night before you slipped through, I thought my wife was dying.
She couldn’t speak any more, she was so frail.
And then you made it through the lines.
Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions.
And potatoes.
Some salted beef, I believe.
Every man in Storm’s End wanted to kiss you that night.
I was relieved they did not.
Robert told me to hold Storm’s End, so I held it.
Then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up.
Insult or no, I gave it up.
Because Robert was my older brother, and he was the king and I’ve always done my duty.
But now, I’m the rightful king by every law of Westeros.
And when I sit the Iron Throne, you’ll be my Hand.
Your Grace, I pray I serve you well.
I expect you’ll be the first crabber’s son to wear the badge.
You’re the Master of Whisperers.
You’re supposed to know everything.
No man can be in all rooms at all times.
I have many little birds in the North, my lord, but I haven’t heard their songs since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell.
The Stark forces are distracted.
Now is the time to strike.
To strike?
My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege?
You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?
If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores of King’s Landing, I’ll ride out to greet him.
A brave choice, Your Grace.
I’m sure your men will line up behind you.
They say Stannis never smiles.
I’ll give him a red smile from ear to ear.
Imagine Stannis’ terror.
I am trying.
You’re an intelligent man.
I’d like to think I’m an intelligent man.
Oh, no one disputes that, my lord, not even the multitudes who despise you.
I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men.
I wish we could, too.
What do you want?
Tell me.
If we’re going to play, you’ll have to start.
My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history.
My sister became queen at the age of .
When I reached manhood, my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock.
A most highborn plumber.
The water never flowed better.
And all the shit found its way to the sea.
I never expected to have any real power.
So when my father named me acting Hand…
You’re quite good at being Hand, you know?
Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men.
Honourable men.
But they disdained the game and those who played.
You enjoy the game.
I do.
Last thing I expected.
And you play it well.
I’d like to keep playing it.
If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over.
They say he burns his enemies alive to honour the Lord of Light.
The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned, the Drowned God wants them drowned.
Why are all the gods such vicious cunts?
Where is the god of tits and wine?
In the Summer Isles, they worship a fertility goddess with teats.
We should sail there immediately.
This morning, I heard a song all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste.
Daenerys Targaryen lives.
A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems.
She has three dragons.
But even if what they say is true, it’ll be years before they are fully grown.
And then there will be nowhere to hide.
One game at a time, my friend.
Careful, Khaleesi.
Xaro owns this city and the warlocks have a thousand eyes watching for you.
I found one.
A ship with a good captain.
She leaves for Astapor tomorrow.
Astapor?
We cannot stay here.
They have my dragons.
A mother does not flee without her children.
They’re not your children.
I know they call you the Mother of Dragons and I know you love them, but you didn’t grow them in your womb.
They didn’t suckle at your breast.
They are dragons, Khaleesi.
And if we stay in Qarth, we’ll die.
You should sail to Astapor.
I’m sure you’ll be safe there.
You know I would die for you.
I will never abandon you.
I’m sworn to protect you, to serve.
Then serve me.
If my dragons are in the House of the Undying, then take me there.
That’s what the warlock wants.
He told you so himself.
If you enter that place, you will never leave again.
His magic is strong.
And what of my magic?
You saw me step into the fire.
You watched the witch burn.
What did the flames do to me?
Do you remember?
Until my last breath, I will remember.
After I have forgotten my mother’s face.
They are my children.
And they are the only children I will ever have.
Take me to them.
We should bury them.
I’d leave ’em up a few more days.
Sends a message.
If they haven’t got the damn message yet, a few more days won’t help.
As you say.
But it don’t hurt to let ’em rot a while longer.
What’s this?
Gold for the farmer.
For his trouble.
His troubles are done.
He’s feeding the crops now.
His wife, too.
You want to keep a man silent, you silence him.
Got as far as the farm and then doubled back.
Walked through the stream to throw off the hounds.
Hoped this would be the last place they’d think to look.
You’re right so far.
Who was that out there hung up at the gates?
Must have been the farmer’s boys.
He killed them and burned them and passed them off as the little lords?
They mustn’t know.
Bran would blame himself.
They’ll never hear it from me.
The little lads have suffered enough.To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
That’s it.
The tide’s against us.
Aye, but we have the wind.
She’ll blow us straight to the gates.
You’re coming home.
King’s Landing hasn’t been home for years.
I spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet.
And now I’m sailing right at them.
This is the royal fleet.
And you’re not a smuggler any more, you’re the high captain.
Of course, there are…
several royal fleets at the moment.
Not after tonight.
When the sun rises, Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne and you will be his Hand.
Gods be good.
God.
Father, there is only one and he watches over us.
But not over them?
Over all of us.
The people of King’s Landing did not choose the false king, Joffrey Baratheon.
They will be glad to see his head on a spike.
Well, first, we have to put it there.
Our ships outnumber theirs to.
Our army outnumber theirs to.
Those walls have never been breached, and the men guarding the walls, when they see you, they don’t see a liberator, they see a stranger come to set their city on fire.
I have faith in the Lord of Light.
I have faith in our cause.
And I have faith in my captain.
Are you afraid, my lion?
If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find.
Of course I’m afraid.
I won’t let them hurt you.
I’m a Lannister.
I don’t have a choice in all this.
But it’s not your war.
It is now.
You can’t fuck your way out of everything.
I have so far.
Do you remember what you said when you met me in your tent?
That I should make love to you like it was your last day on this earth.
As you know, Your Grace, it is not only the sworn duty of a maester to carry out the wishes of the house he serves, but also to offer guidance and counsel in times of war.
Your words are always wise and measured.
If you could…
If anything, a maester’s duties become more urgent in times of war and turmoil.
I remember back in the days of King…
You brought me something?
Yes.
Essence of nightshade is as dangerous as it is efficacious.
A single drop in a cup of wine suffices to soothe ragged nerves.
Three drops will bring on a deep and dreamless sleep.
Ten drops, however…
I know what ten drops will bring.
Your Grace, if I may ask…
You may not.
You must have a lot of work to do.
I’m sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon.
Yes.
A siege is very…
Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester.
There are so many.
Your Grace.
And so he spoke That Lord of Castamere But now the rains weep o’er his halls With no one there to hear Yes, now the rains weep o’er his halls And not a soul to hear Good boys!
Lannisters!
Where’d you learn the Lannister song?
Drunk Lannisters.
You’ve got a pretty voice.
Thank you very much.
And I like your nose.
How many times you break it?
Well, now let’s see.
First time, I was five.
My mam smacked me with an iron poker.
Oh.
It wasn’t me she was aiming at.
She was trying for my little brother.
Now he was a real pest.
Second time, I was nine.
Got in a scrap with a few older boys.
They won.
Third time…
Eh, you don’t want to know about the third time.
Poor nose.
Don’t feel sorry for him.
He’ll be halfway up your arse before the night’s through.
Welcome, friends.
This round’s on me.
I don’t think he likes me.
You think you’re a hard man?
I know it.
It’s warm in here.
We’ve got beautiful women and good brown ale.
Plenty for everyone.
And all you want is to put one of us in the cold ground with no women to keep us company.
Oh, there’s women in the ground.
I put some there myself.
So have you.
You like fucking and drinking and singing.
But killing, killing’s the thing you love.
You’re just like me.
Only smaller.
And quicker.
Eh?
Your Lord Imp’s going to miss you.
Aye…
I expect he will someday.
Here we are.
One more drink before the war?
Shall we?
I’ve always hated the bells.
They ring for horror.
A dead king, a city under siege.
A wedding.
Exactly.
Podrick, is that it?
“Is that it?
” Nice touch.
As if you don’t know the name of every boy in town.
I’m not entirely sure what you’re suggesting.
I’m entirely sure you’re entirely sure what I’m suggesting.
Do you trust him?
Oddly enough, I do.
Good.
The map you asked for.
There must be miles of tunnels beneath the city.
Closer to .
The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary.
I’m not escaping.
Strange as it sounds, I’m the captain of the ship, and if the ship goes down, I go with her.
That is good to hear.
Though I’m sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat.
You look well suited for battle, my lord.
Well, I’m not.
For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong.
My little birds tell me that Stannis Baratheon has taken up with a red priestess from Asshai.
What of it?
You don’t believe in the old powers, my lord?
Blood spells, curses, shapeshifting.
What do you think?
I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen.
You probably don’t entirely trust me.
Mmm, don’t take it personally.
I don’t entirely trust myself.
And yet I have seen things and heard things, things you have not, things I wish I had not.
I don’t believe I’ve ever told you how I was cut.
No, I don’t believe you have.
One day, I will.
The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door.
For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne, I can think of nothing worse.
And tonight, I believe you are the only man who can stop him.
They’re welcoming the new king.
I’ve never known bells to mean surrender.
They want to play music with us?
Let’s play.
Drums.
Drums!
Remember, wait till the ships…
The ships are in the bay.
They must be far enough in…
I know what “in” means.
Do you know how to use that?
I chopped wood once.
No, I watched my brother chopping wood.
I saw you kill a man with a shield.
You’ll be unstoppable with an axe.
Don’t get killed.
Nor you, my friend.
Oh, are we friends now?
Of course we are.
Just because I pay you for your services doesn’t diminish our friendship.
Enhances it, really.
Oh!
“Enhances.
” Fancy word for a sellsword.
Been spending time with fancy folks.
Lady Sansa and Sheila.
Shae.
Shae, yes.
Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor’s holdfast.
She has, my lord, but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off.
Sansa.
Always been a great romantic, my nephew.
Sansa, come here.
I will pray for your safe return, my lord.
Will you?
Just as I pray for the king’s.
Stay safe, my lady.
And you, my lion.
Your king rides forth to battle.
You should see him off with a kiss.
My new blade.
Hearteater, I’ve named it.
Kiss it.
You’ll kiss it again when I return and taste my uncle’s blood.
Will you slay him yourself?
If Stannis is fool enough to come near me.
So you’ll be outside the gates fighting in the vanguard?
A king doesn’t discuss battle plans with stupid girls.
I’m sorry, Your Grace.
You’re right, I’m stupid.
Of course you’ll be in the vanguard.
They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest.
And he is only a pretender.
Your brother’s turn will come.
Then you can lick his blood off Hearteater, too.
Some of those boys will never come back.
Joffrey will.
The worst ones always live.
Shh.
Come, my lady.
Where’s our fleet?
On the way.
Why isn’t it here now?
They’re coming.
Hound, tell the Hand that his king has asked him a question.
The king has asked you a question.
Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king that the Hand is extremely busy.
The Hand of the King would like me to tell you to tell the king…
If I tell the Hound to cut you in half, he’ll do it without a second thought.
That would make me the quarterman.
It just doesn’t have the same ring to it.
Cut me in half and I won’t be able to give the signal.
No signal, no plan.
No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere.
It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too.
I’ve never much liked my head, but I don’t want to see it removed just yet.
Where are their ships?
It was wise to attack at night.
We took them by surprise.
Lord Varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago.
There are no surprises here.
If it’s true there is dissension in their ranks, maybe their sailors have mutinied.
Maybe.
I don’t know why she wants me here.
She’s always saying how stupid I am.
She hates me.
Maybe she hates you less than she hates everyone else.
I doubt it.
Maybe she’s jealous of you.
Why would she be jealous?
Sansa.
I was wondering where our little dove had flown.
You look pale, child.
Is your red flower still blooming?
Yes.
Fitting, isn’t it?
The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here.
Pour Lady Sansa some wine.
I’m not thirsty, Your Grace.
So?
I didn’t offer you water.
What’s he doing here?
Ser Ilyn?
He’s here to defend us.
When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad to have him.
But we have guards to defend us.
Guards we have paid.
Should the city fall, they’ll be the first ones out of the doors.
The lads caught a groom and two maids trying to sneak away with a stolen horse and some gold cups.
The battle’s first traitors.
Have Ser Ilyn see to them.
Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning.
The only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy.
Remember that if you ever hope to become a queen.
You said he was here to protect us.
He is.
Traitors are a danger to us all.
More wine.
There they are.
Archers to their marks.
Archers, to your marks!
Archers!
Nock your arrows!
Nock arrows!
Hold fast.
Hold fast!
What are you doing?
We need to attack them.
Hold fast.
Boulders ready!
Hold fast!
There’s only one ship.
Where are the rest of them?
Where are the rest of them?
There’s only one ship.
Archers, stand to!
Man the below!
Nock.
Nock and set!
Draw!
Hold.
Hold.
There’s no one on board.
More rocks coming up!
Hold.
Wildfire.
Steer clear!
Steer clear!
Matthos!
Get down!
Prepare to land.
Your Grace.
The dwarf has played his little trick.
The wildfire.
He can only play it once.
We’re too far from the gates.
The fire, their archers…
Hundreds will die.
Thousands.
Come with me and take this city!
Sansa, come here, little dove.
My queen.
What are you doing?
Praying.
You’re perfect, aren’t you?
Praying.
What are you praying for?
For the gods to have mercy on us all.
Oh.
On all of us?
Yes, Your Grace.
Even me?
Of course, Your Grace.
Even Joffrey?
Joffrey is my…
Oh, shut up, you little fool.
Praying to the gods to have mercy on us all.
The gods have no mercy.
That’s why they’re gods.
My father told me that when he caught me praying.
My mother had just died, you see.
I didn’t really understand the concept of death, the finality of it.
I thought that if I prayed very, very hard, the gods would return my mother to me.
I was four.
Your father doesn’t believe in the gods?
He believes in them, he just doesn’t like them very much.
One for her.
Here.
Sit.
Drink.
Not like that.
Drink, girl.
I should have been born a man.
I’d rather face a thousand swords than be shut up inside with this flock of frightened hens.
They are your guests under your protection.
You asked them here.
It was expected of me, as it will be of you if you ever become Joffrey’s queen.
If my wretched brother should somehow prevail, these hens will return to their cocks and crow of how my courage inspired them, lifted their spirits.
And if the city should fall?
You’d like that, wouldn’t you?
The Red Keep should hold for a time, long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person.
If it were anyone else outside those gates, I might have hoped for a private audience, but this is Stannis Baratheon.
I’d have a better chance of seducing his horse.
Have I shocked you, little dove?
Tears aren’t a woman’s only weapon.
The best one’s between your legs.
Learn how to use it.
Drink.
Do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked?
No, you wouldn’t, would you?
If the city falls, these fine women should be in for a bit of a rape.
Half of them will have bastards in their bellies come the morning.
You’ll be glad of your red flower then.
When a man’s blood is up, anything with tits looks good.
A precious thing like you will look very, very good.
A slice of cake just waiting to be eaten.
More pressure!
Pull!
Pull!
That’s it, men!
Pull!
Pull!
He’s a serious man, Stannis Baratheon.
They’re coming.
They’re coming ashore.
Rain fire on them.
Archers!
There are too many.
Hound, form a welcome party for any Baratheon troop that manages to touch solid ground.
Pod, run to the King’s Gate.
Bring any men guarding it here, now.
Yes, my lord.
Let’s go.
Stannis is sending us fresh meat.
You, too.
Any of these flaming fucking arrows come near me, I’ll strangle you with your own guts.
Pull, pull!
Go!
Nock!
Draw!
Draw!
Draw!
Kill the Lannisters!
Loose!
Loose!
Draw!
Draw!
Loose!
Loose!
To the Mud Gate, go now!
First and second squads, to the gate!
To the Mud Gate!
Any man dies with a clean sword, I’ll rape his fucking corpse.
When we were young, Jaime and I, we looked so much alike even our father couldn’t tell us apart.
I could never understand why they treated us differently.
Jaime was taught to fight with sword and lance and mace, and I was taught to smile and sing and please.
He was heir to Casterly Rock, and I was sold to some stranger like a horse to be ridden whenever he desired.
You were Robert’s queen.
And you will be Joffrey’s.
Enjoy.
I don’t think I know this one.
Pretty.
That’s the worst curtsy I’ve ever seen.
Here, it’s not difficult.
I mastered it when I was four.
Straighten your back and bend.
Better.
You learn fast.
How long have you been in Lady Sansa’s service?
A few weeks, Your Grace.
When did you leave Lorath?
I had a Lorathi handmaiden once.
But she was a nobleman’s daughter.
You’re not.
When did you come to Westeros?
Ten years ago, Your Grace.
From Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep in years, all without learning how to curtsy.
I imagine that’s a very interesting story.
What’s your name?
Shae, Your Grace.
Tell us a story, Shae.
When I was , I…
Your Grace!
What news?
The Imp has set the river afire.
Hundreds of ships are burning, maybe more.
Stannis’ fleet destroyed, but…
But…
But his troops have landed outside the city walls.
Where is Joffrey?
On the battlements with Lord Tyrion.
Bring him back inside at once.
Your Grace…
What?
The king’s presence is good for morale.
Bring him back to his chambers now.
Not here?
With the women and children?
Do you want him to be mocked as a coward for the rest of his life?
No, but I…
Now!
When I told you about Ser Ilyn earlier, I lied.
Do you want to hear the truth?
You want to know why he’s really here?
He’s here for us.
Stannis may take the city, he may take the throne, but he will not take us alive.
Help me!
Fall back!
Fall back!
Get the ladders up!
Faster, you bastards!
Faster!
Come on, kill the scum!
Someone bring me a drink.
Fuck the water.
Bring me wine.
Can I get you some iced milk and a nice bowl of raspberries, too?
Eat shit, dwarf.
You’re on the wrong side of the wall.
I lost half my men.
The Blackwater’s on fire.
Dog, I command you to go back out there and fight.
You’re Kingsguard, Clegane.
You must beat them back or they’re going to take this city.
Your king’s city.
Fuck the Kingsguard.
Fuck the city.
Fuck the king.
Loose!
Put your backs into it!
All right, get up!
Loose!
Clear!
Forward!
Loose!
Forward ladders!
Heave!
Heave!
Your Grace, the queen has sent me to bring you back to the Red Keep.
If you won’t defend your own city, why should they?
What would you have me do?
Lead.
Get down there and lead your people against the invaders who want to kill them.
What did my mother say exactly?
Did she have urgent business with me?
She did not say, Your Grace.
All men to the battlements!
Ser Boros, Ser Mandon, stay with my uncle and represent the king on the field of battle.
Archers, hold your line or I’ll kill you myself.
Stand fast!
No!
Get up, you fool.
We need more arrows!
Where is the king?
Why isn’t he with us?
Who are we fighting for?
Who leads us?
I’ll lead the attack.
I’ll lead the attack!
Yes.
What are you talking about?
Pod, my helmet.
Ser Mandon, you will bear the king’s banner.
Men, form up.
Men…
Men!
They say I’m half a man.
But what does that make the lot of you?
The only way out is through the gates.
And they’re at the gates.
There’s another way out.
I’m going to show you.
We’ll come out behind them and fuck them in their arses.
Heave!
Heave!
Don’t fight for your king and don’t fight for his kingdoms.
Don’t fight for honour.
Don’t fight for glory.
Don’t fight for riches, because you won’t get any.
This is your city Stannis means to sack.
That’s your gate he’s ramming.
If he gets in, it will be your houses he burns, your gold he steals, your women he will rape.
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
Those are brave men knocking at our door.
Let’s go kill them.
The battle is lost, Your Grace.
Stannis’ troops are at the gates.
When the gold cloaks saw the king leaving, they lost all heart.
Where is my son?
I want to escort him back to the battle.
Why do I care what you want?
Bring me…
Now listen to me…
Don’t be afraid.
The queen has raised the drawbridge.
This is the safest place we can be.
Joffrey’s not hurt.
He’s fighting bravely.
His knights have rallied behind him.
They will save the city.
Shall we sing a hymn?
Gentle mother, font of mercy Save our sons from war, we pray You must go.
Run to your chamber and bar your door.
Stannis won’t hurt you.
This one will.
Come with me.
I need to say goodbye to someone.
The queen said they’d rape everyone.
No one is raping me.
Go.
Run.
The lady is starting to panic.
What are you doing here?
Not here for long.
I’m going.
Where?
Someplace that isn’t burning.
North, might be.
Could be.
What about the king?
He can die just fine on his own.
I can take you with me.
Take you to Winterfell.
I’ll keep you safe.
Do you want to go home?
I’ll be safe here.
Stannis won’t hurt me.
Look at me.
Stannis is a killer.
The Lannisters are killers.
Your father was a killer.
Your brother is a killer.
Your sons will be killers someday.
The world is built by killers.
So you’d better get used to looking at them.
You won’t hurt me.
No, little bird, I won’t hurt you.
Heave!
Come on, you bastards!
Get up those ladders!
Attack!
Roll it over!
Halfman!
Halfman!
Halfman!
Oh, fuck me.
Shh!
Be calm, my sweet.
They’re still fighting.
No one’s going to hurt you.
I’ll tell you a story.
You know the one about the mother lion and her little cub?
They lived in the woods.
The Kingswood?
Yes, my love.
In the Kingswood, there lived a mother and her cub.
She loved him very much.
But there were other things that lived in the woods.
Evil things.
Like what?
Like stags.
Stags aren’t evil.
They only eat grass.
And wolves.
My lord.
He could hear them howling in the night.
The little cub was frightened.
His mother said, “You are a lion, my son.
You mustn’t be afraid.
“For one day, all the beasts will bow to you.
“You will be king.
“All the stags will bow.
All the wolves will bow.
“The bears in the north and the foxes of the south, “all the birds in the sky and the beasts in the sea, “they will all come to you, little lion, “to rest a crown upon your head.
” And the cub said, “Will I be strong and fierce like my father?
” “Yes,” said his mother.
“You will be strong and fierce just like your father.
” I will keep you safe, my love.
I promise you.
Back to the boats!
Stand and fight!
Stand and fight, damn you!
No!
Father.
The battle is over.
We have won.
“And who are you,” the proud lord said “That I must bow so low?
” “Only a cat of a different coat “That’s all the truth I know “In a coat of gold or a coat of red “A lion still has claws “And mine are long and sharp, my lord “As long and sharp as yours” And so he spoke, and so he spoke That Lord of Castamere But now the rains weep o’er his hall With no one there to hear Yes, now the rains weep o’er his hall And not a soul to hearTo find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
Pod.
Pod!
Find Bronn or Varys.
Tell them I am here with Maester Pycelle.
Tell them I am very much alive.
Yes, my lord.
Would you like something for the pain?
What happened?
The murderer and traitor Stannis Baratheon suffered a stunning defeat at the hands of your father.
Where am I?
These are your new chambers.
A little cramped, perhaps, but you don’t need much room, do you?
You are no longer Hand of the King.
For your trouble.
I, Joffrey of the House Baratheon, first of my name, the rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, do hereby proclaim my grandfather, Tywin Lannister, the saviour of the city and the Hand of the King.
Thank you, Your Grace.
Lord Petyr Baelish, step forward.
For your good service and ingenuity in uniting the Houses of Lannister and Tyrell, I declare that you shall be granted the castle of Harrenhal with all its attendant lands and incomes to be held by your sons and grandsons from this day until the end of time.
You honour me beyond words, Your Grace.
I shall have to acquire some sons and grandsons.
Ser Loras Tyrell.
Your house has come to our aid.
The whole realm is in your debt, none more so than I.
If your family would ask anything of me, ask it, and it shall be yours.
Your Grace, my sister Margaery, her husband was taken from us before…
She remains innocent.
I would ask you to find it in your heart to do us the great honour of joining our houses.
Is this what you want, Lady Margaery?
With all my heart, Your Grace.
I have come to love you from afar.
Tales of your courage and wisdom have never been far from my ears.
And those tales have taken root deep inside of me.
I, too, have heard tales of your beauty and grace, but the tales do not do you justice, my lady.
It would be an honour to return your love, but I am promised to another.
A king must keep his word.
Your Grace, in the judgement of your Small Council, it would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason, a girl whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne as we speak.
For the good of the realm, your councillors beg you to set Sansa Stark aside.
Margaery!
We want Margaery!
I would like to heed your wishes and the wishes of my people, but I took a holy vow.
Your Grace, the gods do indeed hold betrothal solemn, but your father, blessed be his memory, made this pact before the Starks revealed their falseness.
I have consulted with the High Septon and he assures me that their crimes against the realm free you from any promise you have made to them in the sight of the gods.
The gods are good.
I am free to heed my heart.
Ser Loras, I will gladly wed your sweet sister.
You will be my queen and I will love you from this day until my last day.
My lady.
My sincerest condolences.
They’re right.
I’m not good enough for him.
You shouldn’t say that.
You’ll be good enough for many things.
He’ll still enjoy beating you.
And now that you’re a woman, he’ll be able to enjoy you in other ways as well.
But, if he’s not marrying me…
He’ll let you go home?
Joffrey’s not the sort of boy who gives away his toys.
You have a tender heart, just like your mother did at your age.
I can see so much of her in you.
She was like a sister to me.
For her sake, I’ll help get you home.
King’s Landing is my home now.
Look around you.
We’re all liars here.
And every one of us is better than you.
Come in.
Make yourself comfortable.
That doesn’t look very comfortable.
Here, watch me.
No need for that, my dear.
You sure?
Most men like what they see.
I’m not like most men.
That’s what most men say.
If you don’t want what most men want, then you’d better tell me what you’d like me to do.
I would like you to tell me if working for Lord Baelish has been all you’d hoped it would be.
Have we met?
You wouldn’t remember me if we had?
I meet a lot of men.
And I think you remember all of them.
I think your true talents are wasted on them.
You’re very kind, my lord.
Allow me to return the favour.
You’re afraid.
Why?
Nothing dangerous down there.
I know who you are.
And, unlike your current employer, I protect those who work for me.
I don’t abuse them to satisfy royal whims or force them to abuse each other.
How do you know about that?
I thought you said you knew who I was.
What can I do for you, Lord Varys?
Littlefinger looks at you and sees a collection of profitable holes.
I see a potential partner.
I’m afraid of him.
Oh, you should be.
He’s a dangerous man.
But everyone has their weaknesses.
Your current employer hides his very well, but not as well as he thinks.
You’re a virgin, I take it?
Walk.
Childhood must have been awful for you.
Were you a foot taller than all the boys?
They laughed at you, called you names?
Some boys like a challenge.
One or two must have tried to get inside Big Brienne.
One or two tried.
Ah.
But you fought them off.
But maybe you wished one of them could overpower you, fling you down, tear off your clothes.
But none of them were strong enough.
I’m strong enough.
Not interested.
Of course you are.
You’d love to know what it feels like to be a woman.
Ah.
“They lay with lions.
” Tavern girls, I’d say.
Probably served my father’s soldiers.
Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel.
That’s how they earned this.
The glorious work of the Northern freedom fighters.
Must make you proud to serve the Starks.
I don’t serve the Starks.
I serve Lady Catelyn.
Tell yourself that tonight when they swing in your dreams.
What are you doing?
Burying them.
We shouldn’t stay here.
We should get back on the river.
I think these women would understand if…
I don’t care what you think.
I didn’t leave it here.
I had me dagger.
Untie me.
Now!
I gave it to you to cut the rope, and now I don’t have me dagger no more.
So unless it got stuck in your arse on its way to your cunt, it stands to reason that it’s gone.
Whoa.
What’s your business here?
Travelling a prisoner.
You’re a woman.
A woman!
Well, fuck me!
If you’ve quite finished up…
All right, we’ll be going.
Whoa.
Whoa!
Who do you fight for?
The Starks.
What did he do?
Apparently eating is now a crime.
Who knew?
No, stealing is a crime.
But it’s not a crime to starve.
That’s justice for you.
Where are you taking him?
To Riverrun.
Why Riverrun?
Steal from the Tullys, it’s their dungeons you rot in.
Why not kill him?
For stealing a pig?
I don’t give the orders.
He must be important to someone.
Sending him with you?
How important could he be?
All right, have it your way, my lady.
Do I know you?
Have you been to Ashemark?
No.
Then you don’t know me.
Do you ever go to the river market at Salt Rock?
Is it near Ashemark?
No.
I’ve never been there.
What do you think of these beauties?
I hope you gave them quick deaths.
Two of them we did, yeah.
Wait.
I do know you.
That’s Jaime Lannister.
I wish someone had told me.
I wouldn’t have had to steal that pig.
If this is the Kingslayer, I think I’d know about it.
How do you know what the Kingslayer looks like?
I was at Whispering Wood.
I saw him.
They dragged him out of the woods and threw him down before the king.
He’s not the Kingslayer.
Sorry to disappoint you.
If he was, I’d only be travelling his head.
I have a question for you both.
And I want you to answer it at the same time.
I count to three, you both answer.
What’s his name?
One.
Two.
Three.
Two quick deaths.
Those were Stark men.
I don’t serve the Starks.
I serve Lady Catelyn.
I told you I’d take you to King’s Landing, and that’s what I’m going to do.
Stay.
Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross.
I know that.
And you mean to do it anyway?
I love her.
I know that seems important to you.
It is important to me.
Your father didn’t love me when we married.
He hardly knew me or I him.
Love didn’t just happen to us.
We built it slowly over the years, stone by stone, for you, for your brothers and sisters, for all of us.
It’s not as exciting as secret passion in the woods, but it is stronger.
It lasts longer.
And that is what would be in store for me with one of Walder Frey’s daughters, what you and father had?
Why not?
Because she’s not beautiful?
Because she’s not exotic and exciting?
Now you’re arguing just to argue because you arranged it.
And you agreed to it.
You gave him your word.
Treat your oaths recklessly, and your people will do the same.
If your father lived his life for one thing…
My father is dead.
And the only parent I have left has no right to call anyone reckless.
You said you saw my victory in the flames.
I did.
I still see it.
The flames lied.
And I’m no better than a savage trusting in a fire god.
I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay.
I led my men to the gates of the seventh hell as their brothers burned alive, and for what?
Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells.
If you see so much in your flames, why didn’t you warn me?
The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses.
You claimed to speak for a god.
Will you quit the war just because you’ve lost a battle?
You talk about war as if you understand it.
I’ve been fighting far longer than you.
Have you?
Show me how you fight.
Show me.
Where’s your god now?
Will he save you?
Where is your god?
Inside you.
I murdered my brother.
We murdered him.
Share the weight with me.
He wasn’t your brother.
This war has just begun.
It will last for years.
Thousands will die at your command.
You will betray the men serving you.
You will betray your family.
You will betray everything you once held dear.
And it will all be worth it because you are the Son of Fire.
You are the Warrior of Light.
You will sweep aside this pretender and that one.
You will be king.
You promise these things, but you don’t know.
None of us know.
Let me show you.
Look into the fire, my king.
Look.
I see fire.
Keep looking.
Do you see?
Do you see, my king?
Yes.
I will kill that man.
I don’t care how many arrows they feather me with, how many spears they run through me, I will kill that hornblowing cunt before I fall.
They want you to know you’re surrounded.
I know I’m surrounded.
I know that because I stood on the battlements and saw I was surrounded.
They don’t want you to sleep.
They want to sap your spirit before…
Thank you, wise bald man.
Thank you for explaining siege tactics to me.
No word from my father?
No.
Send more ravens.
You killed all the ravens.
The first time I saw Winterfell…
First time I saw Winterfell, it looked like something that had been here for thousands of years and would be here for thousands of years after I was dead.
I saw it and I thought, “Of course, Ned Stark crushed our rebellion and killed my brothers.
“We never stood a chance against the man who lives here.
” Lord Stark went out of his way to make it your home.
Yes, my captors were so very kind to me.
You love reminding me of that.
Everyone in this frozen pile of shit has always loved reminding me of that.
You know what it’s like to be told how lucky you are to be someone’s prisoner?
To be told how much you owe them?
And then to go back home to your real father…
I will kill that man.
I swear to the Drowned God, the Old Gods, the New Gods, to every fucking god in every fucking heaven, I will kill that man.
Theon, listen to me.
I serve Winterfell.
Now Winterfell is yours.
I’m bound by oath to serve you.
And what’s your counsel, trusted friend?
Run.
Five hundred Northmen wait outside the walls.
You have men.
You can’t win.
Wait for nightfall and run.
There’s nowhere to run.
I’d never make it back to the Iron Islands.
And even if I did, even if by some miracle I slipped through the lines and made it home, I’d be a coward.
The Greyjoy who ran.
The shame of the family.
Don’t go home.
Join the Night’s Watch.
Once a man has taken the black, he’s beyond reach of the law.
All his past crimes are forgiven.
I won’t make it to the Wall.
I won’t make it feet past the Winterfell gates.
There are ways.
Hidden passageways built so the Lords of Winterfell could escape.
The road will be dangerous.
But with a little luck…
The Night’s Watch is an ancient, honourable order.
You’ll have opportunities there.
The opportunity for Jon Snow to cut my throat in my sleep.
The opportunity to make amends for what you’ve done.
I’ve done a lot, haven’t I?
Things I never imagined myself doing.
I’ve known you many years, Theon Greyjoy.
You’re not the man you’re pretending to be.
Not yet.
You may be right.
But I’ve gone too far to pretend to be anything else.
You hear that?
That’s the mating call of the Northmen.
They want to fuck us.
Well, I haven’t had a good fuck in weeks.
I’m ready for one.
They say every ironborn man is worth a dozen from the mainland.
Aye!
You think they’re right?
Aye.
We die today, brothers.
We die bleeding from wounds with arrows in our necks and spears in our guts, but our war cries will echo through eternity.
They will sing about the battle of Winterfell until the Iron Islands have slipped beneath the waves.
Every man, woman and child will know who we were and how long we stood.
Aggar and Gelmarr, Wex and Urzen, Stygg and Black Lorren.
Ironborn warriors will cry out our names as they leap onto the shores of Seagard and Faircastle.
Aye!
Mothers will name their sons for us.
Aye!
Girls will think of us with their lovers inside them.
Aye!
And whoever kills that fucking hornblower will stand in bronze above the shores of Pyke!
Aye!
What is dead may never die!
What is dead may never die!
Thought he’d never shut up.
It was a good speech.
Didn’t want to interrupt.
What is this?
What are you doing?
Let’s go home.
Come on.
Why should I believe you?
Why would I lie about it?
To create strife between my sister and me.
Where before there was nothing but love.
Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you on your sister’s orders.
If it weren’t for your squire’s bravery, you’d be a dead man.
Pod.
Yes, my lord?
Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week?
No, my lord.
You’re a good lad.
Get Bronn, tell him I want four of his most loyal gold cloaks outside my door at all times.
I’m afraid your friend has been relieved of his command of the City Watch.
The gold cloaks are now firmly in the hands of your father or your sister.
It varies from cloak to cloak.
Then my hill tribesmen.
Have gone home.
Your father paid them quite handsomely.
I’m afraid we won’t be seeing each other for some time, my lord.
Don’t want to swim too close to a drowning man?
And I thought we were friends.
We are.
Podrick, would you mind?
There are many who know that without you this city faced certain defeat.
The king won’t give you any honours, the histories won’t mention you, but we will not forget.
Come along now, Podrick.
My love.
It was good of you to come.
Good of me?
Of course I come.
I want to see you.
Believe me, you don’t.
Have you looked?
I will be the first.
Well?
You are a mess.
I’m a monster as well as a dwarf.
You should charge me double.
You think I’m here for money?
That was the arrangement we made.
I pay you and you lie to me.
Oh.
I’m a poor little rich man and nobody loves me, so I make jokes all the time and pay them to laugh.
Fuck your money.
Let’s leave.
Leave?
Leave King’s Landing.
They tried to kill you.
They will try again.
Going into wars, fighting soldiers, you’re terrible at this.
Let’s take a boat to Pentos and never come back.
You don’t belong here.
What would we do in Pentos?
Eat, drink, fuck, live.
I want to go with you.
So do it.
Your father, your sister, all these bad people, they can’t stop you.
Forget about them.
Come with me.
I can’t.
I do belong here.
These bad people are what I’m good at.
Outtalking them, outthinking them.
It’s what I am.
And I like it.
I like it more than anything I’ve ever done.
Are you going to leave?
You have a shit memory.
I am yours and you are mine.
In the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one for eternity.
Look upon one another and say the words.
Father, smith…
Father, smith…
warrior, mother…
warrior, mother…
maiden, crone, stranger.
maiden, crone, stranger.
I am hers and she is mine…
I am his and he is mine…
from this day until the end of my days.
from this day until the end of my days.
A house of ghosts, Khaleesi.
It is known.
Where are the guards?
No guards.
The warlocks kill with sorcery, not steel.
Let them try.
Is this a riddle?
Khaleesi!
Khaleesi!
Khaleesi!
Are you trying to frighten me with magic tricks?
You want me?
Here I am.
Are you afraid of a little girl?
How did he find us?
What are you doing here?
Waiting for you.
How did you know we’d come this way?
After all the things you have seen, this is your question?
How did you kill those guards?
Was it hard?
No harder than taking a new name, if you know the way.
Show me how.
I want to be able to do it, too.
If you would learn, you must come with me.
Where?
Far and away across the Narrow Sea to Braavos.
My dancing master was from Braavos.
To be a dancing master is a special thing, but to be a faceless man, that is something else entirely.
The girl has many names on her lips.
Joffrey, Cersei, Tywin Lannister, Ilyn Payne, the Hound.
Names to offer up to the Red God.
She could offer them all one by one.
I want to.
But I can’t.
I need to find my brother and mother.
And my sister.
I need to find her, too.
Then we must part.
A man has duties as well.
Here.
What is it?
A coin of great value.
Could it buy a horse?
It is not meant for the buying of horses.
Then what good is it?
If the day comes when you must find me again, just give that coin to any man from Braavos and say these words to him, “Valar Morghulis.
” Valar Morghulis.
Please don’t go, Jaqen.
Jaqen is dead.
Say it again.
Valar Morghulis.
Valar Morghulis.
Good.
Farewell, Arya Stark.
Osha, what are you doing?
Tell us what medicine to get from your chambers.
We’ll make you better.
I feel just fine.
They burned it down.
They burned everything.
Not everything.
Not you.
But they may come back.
You have to go.
Put on your warmest clothes.
Pack as much food as you can carry and go north.
North’s the wrong way.
And Mother and brother are south.
We don’t know where.
There are too many enemies in the south.
Go to the Wall, to Jon.
He’ll look after you and let your mother know you’re safe.
I don’t want to leave you.
No more than I want to leave you.
I pulled you into the world.
Both of you.
I’ve seen both your faces almost every day since.
And for that, I consider myself very, very lucky.
Go now with Hodor.
Go on.
I’ll be right here.
Osha.
You must protect them.
You’re the only one who can.
You may have to protect them against your own kind.
I’ve got no great love for my own kind.
I’ll get you milk of the poppy.
Tell me where to find it.
I don’t want milk of the poppy.
Do it quickly.
Moon of my life.
This is dark magic, like the magic that took you from me.
Took you from me before I could even…
Maybe I am dead and I just don’t know it yet.
Maybe I am with you in the Night Lands.
Or maybe I refused to enter the Night Lands without you.
Maybe I told the Great Stallion to go fuck himself and came back here to wait for you.
That sounds like something you would do.
Or maybe it is a dream.
Your dream, my dream…
…
I do not know.
These are questions for wise men with skinny arms.
You are the moon of my life.
That is all I know…
…
and all I need to know.
And if this is a dream…
…
I will kill the man who tries to wake me.
Until the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, until the rivers run dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.
They miss their mother.
They want to be with you.
Do you want to be with them?
You will be.
When your dragons were born, our magic was born again.
It is strongest in their presence.
And they are strongest in yours.
You will be with them, through winter, summer, winter again.
Across a thousand, thousand seasons you will be with them.
And we will be with you until time comes to an end.
Welcome home, Daenerys Stormborn.
This is not my home.
My home is across the sea, where my people are waiting for me.
They will be waiting a long time.
Dracarys.
We should be there by sundown.
Won’t be a fun night for you.
Mance knows how to make crows sing.
If you know what to say, you might just make it through the night.
Not talking’s not the way to go.
Careful with that.
You might cut yourself.
Never swung a sword before, have you?
You look like a baby with a rattle.
Enough of that!
Stop!
Why, traitor?
So you can give Mance Rayder an invitation to Castle Black?
Let ’em fight.
That’s it?
That’s what you can do?
You little shit.
Your traitor father teach you that?
Or was it your whore mother?
We are the watchers on the Wall.
You can tell Mance that’s the man who killed Qhorin Halfhand.
Burn the body.
Aye.
You don’t want this one coming back for you.
Come along, Jon Snow.
Time to meet the KingbeyondtheWall.
What the…
Khaleesi, please.
He said you’d never leave Qarth alive.
Come.
Nothing.
Thank you, Xaro Xhoan Daxos.
Thank you for teaching me this lesson.
I am king of Qarth.
I can help you now, truly help you.
We can take the Iron Throne.
I’ll bring you a thousand ships.
Please, Khaleesi, I beg you.
All that you have dreamed is within your reach!
I beg you, please!
Khaleesi.
Please!
Please!
Khaleesi!
It’s all a lie.
Looks real enough to me.
Real enough to buy a ship?
Aye, a small ship.
Take all the gold and jewels.
I thought we were coming north to fight wildlings.
Is this goat?
It’s moose.
People shouldn’t live anywhere you need to burn shit to keep warm.
Well, you see a tree, let me know.
If you step back and think about it, the thing about Gilly that’s so interesting is…
Just bloody kill me.
No, truly.
The thing about her that I find so interesting is that after all that Craster’s done to her, she’s still got hope that life might get better.
The thing about Gilly that you find so interesting is that she said six words to you.
And the thing about you that I find so interesting is absolutely nothing.
It’s Jon and the Halfhand.
They’re back.
Two blasts is wildlings.
You’re not fighting them alone.
Come on.
Three blasts?
Run!
Wait!
Wait for me!
Grenn!
Edd!To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
Fall back!
Brother?
Did you send the ravens?
Tarly, look at me.
Did you send the ravens?
That was your job.
Your only job.
We need to get back to the Wall.
It’s a long march.
We know what’s out there, but we have to make it, have to warn them or before winter’s done, everyone you’ve ever known will be dead.
First time you’ve seen a giant, Jon Snow?
Well, don’t stare too long.
They’re shy.
When they stop being shy, they get angry.
And when they’re angry, I’ve seen them pound a man straight into the ground like a hammer on a nail.
Crow!
Crow!
Look over there!
Crow!
Crow!
Look over here!
Look!
Look, crow coming!
Crow!
You’re wearing the wrong colour.
Mance was a ranger.
In your hearts, all you crows want to fly free.
When I’m free, will I be free to go?
Crow!
Crow!
Sure, you will.
And I’ll be free to kill you.
Got no respect, this lot.
Got no fathers to slap them when they’re foul.
What happened to their fathers?
Some of them were killed by crows like you.
Don’t look so grim, Jon Snow.
If Mance Rayder likes you, you’ll live another day.
And if he don’t…
I smell a crow.
We killed his friends.
Thought you’d want to question this one.
What do we want with a baby crow?
This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand.
He wants to be one of us.
That halfhanded cunt killed friends of mine.
Friends twice your size.
My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts.
Plenty of little men tried to put their swords through my heart.
And there’s plenty of little skeletons buried in the woods.
What’s your name, boy?
Jon Snow.
Your Grace.
Your Grace?
Did you hear that?
From now on, you’d better kneel every time I fart.
Stand, boy.
We don’t kneel for anyone beyond the Wall.
So, you’re Ned Stark’s bastard.
Thank you for the gift, Lord of Bones.
You can leave us.
The girl likes you.
You like her back, Snow?
That why you want to join us?
Don’t panic, boy.
This isn’t the damned Night’s Watch where we make you swear off girls.
This chicken eater you thought was king is Tormund Giantsbane.
Can’t believe this pup killed the Halfhand.
He was our enemy and I’m glad he’s dead.
He was my brother once.
Back when he had a whole hand.
What were you doing with him?
The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning.
Why?
He wants me to lead one day.
But here you are, a traitor, kneeling before the KingbeyondtheWall.
If I’m a traitor, then you are, too.
Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow?
I want to be free.
No, I don’t think so.
I think what you want most of all is to be a hero.
I’ll ask you one last time, why do you want to join us?
We stopped at Craster’s Keep on the way north.
I saw…
You saw what?
I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods.
I saw what took it.
You’re telling me you saw one of them?
And why would that make you desert your brothers?
Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew.
Thousands of years ago, the First Men defeated the White Walkers.
I want to fight for the side that fights for the living.
Did I come to the right place?
We’ll need to find you a new cloak.
What if you took off that bit there?
Don’t you want to leave something to the imagination?
Trouble is, I’ve never had much imagination.
I want you to take it off.
Mouth.
Ser Bronn.
Ser Bronn.
I didn’t hear that.
Apologies, ser.
Back away.
Keep backing away till you’re outside this establishment.
Then back away some more.
Lord Tyrion sent me.
I will murder you, boy.
He said it was a matter of life and death.
Pod?
It’s your sister.
The queen.
What are they doing here?
Protecting me, I assume.
Will you let me in?
No, I don’t think so.
If I wanted to kill you, do you think I’d let a wooden door stop me?
They stay outside.
I’m not afraid of you, little brother.
Why are you here?
I wanted to see your face.
They said you’d lost your nose, but it’s not as gruesome as all that.
The man who cut me lost more than his nose.
I should hope so.
The rebels came for Joffrey’s head, they lost their own.
Thanks to Father.
Thanks to Father.
Of course, it wasn’t a rebel who tried to kill me.
No?
Curious.
Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand.
But then I don’t suppose you need much room.
Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke.
You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees.
You’re meeting Father today?
How do you know that?
Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ.
The Master of Whisperers owes me a favour or two.
Father told me.
What do you want from him?
What do I want from him?
He’s my father.
Do I need to want something?
I’m sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy.
Yet he hasn’t come to visit once…
Hmm.
…
since arriving in King’s Landing.
I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came.
You’re going to make me cry.
Why do you care what I want from him?
Because you’ve slandered me to Father before.
Slandered?
When?
You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.
You did have your guards beat her.
A girl of nine, I believe.
I was nine, too.
She lost an eye, if I remember correctly.
If I remember correctly, she never stole a necklace again.
It’s not slander if it’s true.
And what’s this truth you plan on telling him today?
Why are you so nervous about what I’m going to say to Father?
Because you’re a liar.
I expect you’ll tell lies about me, about Joffrey.
Any lies in particular?
You’re a clever man, but not as clever as you think you are.
Mmm.
Still makes me more clever than you.
Ah.
Look at these two shining warriors.
Ser Taryn Mant and Ser Whosit of Whocares.
Ser Meryn Trant.
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
You’re no knight.
Pod.
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater was anointed by the king himself.
You’re an upjumped cutthroat, nothing more.
That’s exactly who I am.
And you’re a grub in fancy armour who’s better at beating little girls than fighting men.
Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion.
You put your hand on that door, you lose the hand.
As much as I appreciate a walk in the sunshine, I am wondering why you sent for me.
Many people in this city want to kill me.
You’re here to protect me.
I’ve been doing that for a while now.
Do you grow bored protecting me?
I grow poor protecting you.
Poor?
Poor?
Under my patronage you’ve become a knight, you’ve served as Commander of the City Watch.
Briefly.
I’m sure you filled your pockets.
And now my pockets are empty.
You’ve given me a taste for the finer things.
And if you want me protecting you, you’ll need to pay more.
I thought we were friends.
We are.
But I’m a sellsword.
I sell my sword.
I don’t loan it out to friends as a favour.
How much?
Double.
Double?
I’m a knight now.
Knights are worth double.
I don’t even know how much I’m paying you now.
Which means you can afford it.
Here.
Here!
Help me!
Who are you?
I was in the battle at Blackwater.
I was a captain and a knight.
Aye, ser, and serving which king?
The one true king of Westeros, Stannis Baratheon.
I thought you were dead.
Everyone thought you were dead.
And your son?
He may have swam ashore as you did.
No, the wildfire took him.
I saw it.
I’m so sorry, my friend.
I, too, have lost a son.
There is nothing worse in this world.
But, Davos, you were a good father.
If I was a good father, he’d still be here.
Stannis lives?
He licks his wounds at Dragonstone.
Will you take me there?
There is nothing for me at Dragonstone.
This war is not over.
Not for you, maybe.
But for Salladhor Saan, the war is over.
We’re both sworn to King Stannis.
I am sworn to no man.
I promised you ships and you promised me riches and glory.
I delivered the ships.
Stannis never gives up.
Never.
Now he will regroup…
He’s a broken man.
His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.
They say he sees no one, not his generals, not even his wife.
Only the Red Woman whispering in his ear, telling him what she sees in the flames and burning men alive.
What?
They built a great fire when Stannis returned.
All those who spoke against her she called servants of darkness.
They say she sang to them as they burned.
I’m a pirate.
You’re a smuggler.
Servants of darkness.
I’m thinking Dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid.
Take me back there, please.
You cannot turn Stannis against her.
Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out.
You could try.
If you fail, they will burn you.
If you succeed, they’ll burn you.
And you’ve only just come back to life.
Stay alive a little longer, my friend.
You call me friend.
You drank with me on my wedding day.
And you drank with me on four of mine, but I don’t ask you for favours.
I have to stop her.
Please, do this for me.
When you are dead, I will gather your bones in a little sack and let your widow wear them around her neck.
We should set the siege lines , yards from Harrenhal.
There won’t be a siege.
The Mountain can’t defend a ruin.
The Mountain will defend whatever Tywin Lannister tells him.
The Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross.
I’d love a fight.
The men would love a fight.
I don’t think we’re going to get one.
Two hundred Northmen slaughtered like sheep.
The debt will be repaid, my friend.
For them and for your sons.
Will it?
They rot in the ground while their killer runs free.
The Kingslayer won’t remain free for long.
My best hunters are after him.
A Mallister?
Ser Jeremy.
My father’s bannerman.
Find her a chamber that will serve as a cell.
She’s your mother.
She freed Jaime Lannister.
The Lannisters robbed them of their sons and she robbed them of their justice.
Water.
Water.
This needs to be cleaned and closed.
What’s your name, friend?
Qyburn.
You’re lucky to be alive.
Lucky?
The badge looks good on you.
Almost as good as it looked on me.
Are you enjoying your new position?
Am I enjoying it?
I was very happy as Hand of the King.
Yes.
I heard how happy you were.
You brought a whore into my bed.
It wasn’t your bed at the time.
I sent you here to advise the king.
I gave you real power and authority.
You chose to spend your days as you always have, bedding harlots and drinking with thieves.
Occasionally I drank with the harlots.
What do you want, Tyrion?
Why does everyone assume I want something?
Can’t I simply visit with my beloved father?
My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield.
Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal.
I organised the defence of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal.
I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls.
I bled in the mud for our family.
And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell.
But what do I want?
A little bloody gratitude would be a start.
Jugglers and singers require applause.
You are a Lannister.
Do you think I demanded a garland of roses every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield?
Hmm?
Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion.
So tell me what you want.
I want what is mine by right.
Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles.
But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance.
The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock.
I am your son and lawful heir.
You want Casterly Rock?
It is mine by right.
We’ll find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishments during the battle of Blackwater Bay.
And when the time is right, you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy.
And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife.
And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock.
Why?
Why?
You ask that?
You, who killed your mother to come into the world?
You are an illmade, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning.
Men’s laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colours since I cannot prove that you are not mine.
And to teach me humility, the Gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father’s sigil and his father’s before him.
But neither Gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse.
Go, now.
Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock.
Go.
One more thing.
The next whore I catch in your bed I’ll hang.
Dorne.
It’s going to Dorne.
Why Dorne?
It’s carrying silk and it’s supposed to bring back wine in exchange.
But it’s not coming back.
The captain’s tired of risking his life so King’s Landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve.
He’s going to stay in Dorne.
Wait out the winter where it’s beautiful and warm.
I met some people in Dorne who weren’t so beautiful and warm.
Don’t ruin the game.
I told you, I don’t want to play.
What about that one there?
That one?
It’s going to Volantis.
Why?
Because when I got on a ship in Volantis, it looked like that one.
That’s not how the game works.
You’re not supposed to just blurt out the right answer.
You’ve got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why.
Why should I make up a story when I know the truth?
Because the truth is always either terrible or boring.
Lovely day for it.
Watching the ships.
Lord Baelish.
Might I speak with Lady Sansa alone for a moment?
I saw your mother not long ago.
She’s very eager to see you.
And your sister.
Arya’s alive?
You said you’d take me home.
You said King’s Landing was your home.
You are the property of the crown.
Stealing you would be treason.
If you were to tell just one person…
I won’t tell anyone.
How do I know?
Because I’m a terrible liar.
You said so yourself.
Please, Lord Baelish.
Tell me what to do.
Tell me when.
I’m waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital.
When I set sail, I might be able to take you with me.
But you’ll need to be ready to leave on a moment’s notice.
You’re her handmaiden?
Yes.
And you’re his…
I help manage his affairs.
He’s an important person.
So is she.
I grew up in the shadow of her father’s castle.
The day she was born, they rang the bells from sunrise till sunset.
We’ve both done rather well, you and I.
Yes.
Given where we started.
And where is that?
It’s not easy for girls like us to dig our way out.
Watch out for her.
I always do.
Watch out for her with him.
They’re growing fast.
Not fast enough.
I can’t wait that long.
I need an army.
We’ll be in Astapor by nightfall.
Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world.
The greatest slavesoldiers in the world.
The distinction means a good deal to some people.
Do those people have any better ideas about how to put you on the Iron Throne?
It’s too beautiful a day to argue.
You’re right.
Another lovely day on the high seas.
Don’t mock them.
They’re the first Dothraki on a ship.
They followed me across the poison water.
If they’ll do it, others will.
And with a true khalasar…
The Dothraki follow strength above all, Khaleesi.
You’ll have a true khalasar when you prove yourself strong.
And not before.
Your Grace.
I heard you were dead.
Not yet.
I had hoped to speak to you alone, Your Grace.
We are alone.
Your Grace, you are the rightful king.
Not only by blood.
You’re an honourable man, a just man.
And there is still a war to fight.
I am fighting.
By burning prisoners alive?
How would you punish the infidels, Ser Davos?
I do not judge people for the Gods they worship.
If I did, I’d have thrown you in the sea before you ever set foot on Dragonstone.
I’m not your enemy.
You are my enemy.
Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay?
Did I set your ships ablaze?
I wasn’t there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands.
I could have saved those men.
You would have taken the city, Stannis would sit upon his rightful throne, and you would stand beside him.
But I wasn’t there because you convinced your king to leave me behind.
Do you hear them screaming?
All those burning men in the water crying for their mothers, for their Gods for help?
Until the moment the Blackwater swallowed them.
Don’t despair, Ser Davos.
What I told your son is true.
Death by fire is the purest death.
This woman is evil!
She’s the mother of demons.
Take him and lock him in a cell.
Your Grace!
Come on.
You’ve chosen the darkness, Ser Davos.
She will destroy us all!
I will pray for you.
Your Grace!
Halt.
Down.
Halt.
Down.
Why have we stopped?
It’s Lady Margaery, Your Grace.
What is she doing?
Who gave her permission?
My lady.
We should have guards, my lady.
Why?
Pardon me.
Stop, my lady.
You’ll ruin your dress.
I have others.
Would you like to speak with her, Your Grace?
No.
He was a soldier.
He went to fight on the walls when the ships came into Blackwater Bay.
He never came back.
And your mother?
She died when she had me.
Bad men wanted to come into this city and do terrible things, but your father stopped them.
Whenever you look at this knight, I want you to remember your father.
He wasn’t a knight.
He was just a soldier.
And what do knights swear to do?
Protect the weak and uphold the good.
Your father did that.
Be proud of him.
Was your father a soldier, too?
You should be proud, too.
Under King Joffrey’s leadership, your fathers saved the city.
They saved us all.
From now on, we’re going to take care of you.
All of you.
Come to me for what you need to feed them, clothe them, or house them.
Directly to me.
Your Grace.
Your Grace.
Please, sit.
Sit.
I do apologise, my lady.
Small Council meetings.
At what point does it become treason to waste the king’s time?
That’s a lovely gown, my lady.
Yes, it suits you perfectly.
I imagine you might be rather cold.
The climate is a bit more forgiving back in Highgarden, Your Grace.
Shall I have them bring you a shawl, my lady?
I am touched by your concern, Your Grace.
Luckily for us Tyrells, our blood runs quite warm.
Doesn’t it, Loras?
Yes.
Loras, isn’t the queen’s gown magnificent?
The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork.
I’ve never seen anything like it.
You might find a bit of armour quite useful once you become queen.
Perhaps before.
Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning.
Yes.
I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about.
Margaery does a great deal of work with the poor back in Highgarden.
The lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance and approach them with an open heart.
An open heart is what you’ll get if you’re not careful, my dear.
Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there.
We had a full complement of guards that didn’t stop them.
The king barely escaped with his life.
My mother’s always had a penchant for drama.
Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older.
Our lives were never truly in danger.
You’re right, of course.
But you are your father’s son.
We can’t all have a king’s bravery.
Hunger turns men into beasts.
I’m glad House Tyrell has been able to help in this regard.
They tell me wagons arrive daily now from the Reach.
Wheat, barley, apples.
We’ve had a blessed harvest.
And it’s our duty to assist the capital in time of need.
Well, as Ser Loras said, Lady Margaery has done this sort of, uh, charitable work before.
I’m sure she knows what she’s doing.
I’m sure she does.
The Unsullied have stood here for a day and a night with no food or water.
They will stand until they drop.
Such is their obedience.
They may suit my needs.
Tell me of their training.
The Westerosi woman is pleased with them, but speaks no praise to keep the price down.
She wishes to know how they are trained.
Tell her what she would know and be quick about it.
The day is hot.
They begin their training at .
Every day they drill from dawn to dusk until they have mastered the shortsword, the shield, and the three spears.
Only one boy in four survives this rigorous training.
Their discipline and loyalty are absolute.
They fear nothing.
Even the bravest men fear death.
The knight says even brave men fear death.
Tell the old man he smells of piss.
Truly, Master?
No, not truly.
Are you a girl or a goat to ask such a thing?
My master says the Unsullied are not men.
Death means nothing to them.
Tell this ignorant whore of a Westerner to open her eyes and watch.
He begs you attend to this carefully, Your Grace.
Tell the good master there is no need.
She’s worried about their nipples?
Does the dumb bitch know we’ve cut off their balls?
My master points out that men don’t need nipples.
Here, I’m done with you.
This one is pleased to have served you.
To win his shield, an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark, find a newborn and kill it before its mother’s eyes.
This way, my master says, we make certain there is no weakness left in them.
You take a babe from its mother’s arms, kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin?
She is offended.
She asks if you pay a silver coin to the mother, for her dead baby.
What a soft mewling fool this one is.
My master would like you to know that the silver is paid to the baby’s owner, not the mother.
How many do you have to sell?
Eight thousand.
Tell the Westerosi whore she has until tomorrow.
Master Kraznys asks that you please hurry.
Many other buyers are interested.
Eight thousand dead babies.
The Unsullied are a means to an end.
Once I own them, these men…
They’re not men.
Not any more.
Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be?
You think these slaves will have better lives serving men like Kraznys or serving you?
You’ll be fair to them.
You won’t mutilate them to make a point.
You won’t order them to murder babies.
You’ll see they’re properly fed and sheltered.
A great injustice has been done to them.
Closing your eyes will not undo it.
The warlocks.
I owe you my life, ser.
The honour is mine, my queen.
You know this man?
I know him as one of the greatest fighters the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen and as the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon’s Kingsguard.
King Robert is dead.
I have been searching for you, Daenerys Stormborn, to ask your forgiveness.
I was sworn to protect your family.
I failed them.
I am Barristan Selmy, Kingsguard to your father.
Allow me to join your Queensguard and I will not fail you again.To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
Don’t think too much, Bran.
Relax your bow arm.
And which one of you was a marksman at ?
Father?
You can’t kill it, you know.
Why not?
Because the raven is you.
Hodor.
It’s all right, Hodor.
Hodor.
Were you inside the wolf again, little lord?
No, it was the threeeyed raven.
He’s back.
I tried to kill it, but I couldn’t.
There was a boy.
I don’t want to hear about it.
But you asked.
We’ve got plenty of worries.
We don’t need to pour black magic on top of them.
I didn’t ask for black magic dreams.
I know you didn’t, little lord.
We need to move.
We don’t know who might be after us.
No one knows we’re alive.
And who told you that?
The threeeyed raven tell you?
No.
Some good he is, then.
I don’t know what people know and don’t.
I only know the Wall is a long way off.
My mother always told me you Westerosi were a grim lot.
Grim, bearded, stinking barbarians that would row across the Narrow Sea and steal us from our beds.
Did you ever think you’d marry one?
I never thought I’d marry anyone at all.
Never?
Not until I met the king of the grim, bearded, stinking barbarians.
Pardon me, Your Grace.
My queen.
Lord Bolton.
Let me guess which is the good news.
Word from Riverrun and Winterfell.
I hadn’t seen him in years.
I don’t even know how many.
We’ll travel to the funeral together.
Lord Bolton will garrison here until we return.
Will I be wearing manacles when I lay my father to rest?
Something else?
Before Bolton’s bastard got to Winterfell, the ironborn were gone.
They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch.
And Bran and Rickon have not been found.
They may have escaped.
Or Theon may have taken them to the Iron Islands as hostages.
Have you received any demands?
No.
Have you heard anything from Theon at all?
Where am I?
Who are you?
What do you want?
I want to do this.
Do you know how long it’ll take to get to King’s Landing walking through fields and forests?
Yes.
How shall we pass the time?
By putting one foot in front of the other.
It’s going to be a very dull walk.
I’m here to take you to King’s Landing and bring back Lady Stark’s daughters in exchange.
Dull is fine.
You know, it doesn’t matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humourless mute.
Trust me on this.
People have been serving me since I was born.
You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life?
A week’s journey with you and she’ll order you to fall on your sword.
If Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service, I’m sure she’ll let me know.
She’s an honest woman.
For all the good it’s done her.
How did you come into Lady Stark’s service?
There’s something we can talk about.
Not your concern, Kingslayer.
It had to be recently.
You weren’t with her at Winterfell.
How would you know?
Because I visited Winterfell.
I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways.
Move.
Were you pledged to Stannis?
Gods, no.
Ah, Renly.
Really?
He wasn’t fit to rule over anything more important than a course meal.
Shut your mouth.
Why?
I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don’t forget.
Could hardly escape the little tulip.
Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks.
I knew him better than you.
I knew him as well as anyone.
As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything.
He would have been a wonderful king.
Sounds like you quite fancied him.
I did not fancy him.
Oh, Gods, you did.
Did you ever tell him?
No, of course not.
You weren’t Renly’s type, I’m afraid.
He preferred curlyhaired little girls like Loras Tyrell.
You’re far too much man for him.
I’m not interested in foul rumours.
Unless they’re about me.
It’s all true about Renly.
His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court.
It’s a shame the throne isn’t made out of cocks.
They’d have never got him off it.
Shut your mouth!
I don’t blame him.
And I don’t blame you, either.
We don’t get to choose who we love.
Where are you headed, then?
South.
You?
Riverrun.
Staying off the King’s Road, are you?
They get you no matter where you go.
You can’t win.
No, you really can’t.
Looks like you’re safe enough.
Meaning no offence, my lady, but I wouldn’t tangle with you.
Seven blessings to you.
And you.
He knows who I am.
He doesn’t.
Maybe you’re right.
What if you’re not?
What if he tells someone?
We’re not doing it.
He’s an innocent man.
More innocent than Lady Stark’s daughters?
Make it tighter here.
Mmm.
That’s better.
It makes you look very strong.
No flowers.
I said no flowers.
All these are wrong.
Bring others.
Yes, Your Grace.
Bloody flowers.
On the king.
Looks like a Tyrell rose.
Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown.
Should be more than enough fabric.
Tell me what you think of her.
Who?
Margaery.
She’s an ideal match.
With the Tyrells beside us, we’ll crush the Northerners.
Hang their lords, burn their strongholds, sow their fields with salt, and no one will think of rebelling for another century.
It is a good match, but what do you think of her?
She’s beautiful and intelligent.
Yes, she is.
Her concern with the wellbeing of the common people is interesting.
Not to me.
I only meant to go out of your way to endanger…
This is becoming one of the most boring conversations I’ve ever had.
Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason.
She dresses like a harlot for a reason.
Married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason.
She married Renly Baratheon because she was told to.
That’s what intelligent women do.
What they’re told.
You need to ask yourself…
I don’t need to do anything.
Better.
Much better.
I still don’t believe it.
He didn’t want anything.
He just takes an interest because he loved my mother.
Men only want one thing from a pretty girl.
Littlefinger’s not in love with me.
Love is not the thing he wants.
He’s too old.
They never see it that way.
He didn’t ask you to do something for him?
Spy on someone or…
No.
If he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you, I want you to tell me.
Why?
What will you do?
I will make him stop.
Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady.
Send him in.
Lady Sansa.
Ser Loras.
My sister invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother, the Lady Olenna, in the gardens.
May I escort you to them?
I believe you grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa.
You are too kind, Ser Loras.
You probably don’t remember the first time we met.
At the Hand’s tourney, you gave me your favour.
A rose, a red rose.
Of course I did.
It’s more your colour.
You take it.
Thank you.
You’re such a dear.
I’ll take my leave.
Lady Sansa.
Thank you, Ser Loras.
Come.
Lady Sansa, it is my honour to present my grandmother.
The Lady Olenna of House Tyrell.
Kiss me, child.
It’s so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens.
We’re very sorry for your losses.
And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renly’s death, Lady Margaery.
He was very gallant.
Yes.
And charming and very clean.
He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king.
Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother.
Father liked him and so did Loras.
Loras is young and good at knocking men off horses with a stick.
That does not make him wise.
As to your fathead father…
Grandmother!
What will Sansa think of us?
She might think we have some wits about us.
One of us, at any rate.
It was treason.
I warned them.
Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother.
How can he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair?
We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me.
But once the cow’s been milked, there’s no squirting the cream back up her udders.
So here we are to see things through.
What do you say to that, Sansa?
Shall we have some lemon cakes?
Lemon cake’s my favourite.
So we’ve been told.
Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death?
Here, Sansa, come sit with me.
I’m much less boring than these others.
Do you know my son?
The Lord of Highgarden?
I haven’t had the pleasure.
Mmm.
No great pleasure, believe me.
A ponderous oaf.
His father was an oaf as well.
My husband, the late Lord Luthor.
He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking.
They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him.
And now my son is doing the same, only this time he’s riding a lion instead of a horse.
Now…
I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy, this Joffrey.
I…
I…
You, you.
Who else would know better?
We’ve heard some troubling tales.
Is there any truth to them?
Has this boy mistreated you?
Has he ripped out your tongue?
King Joffrey, His Grace is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion.
Yes, all Lannisters are lions.
And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose.
But how kind is he?
How clever?
Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?
I’m to be his wife.
I only want to know what that means.
Bring me some cheese.
Cheese will be served after the cakes, my lady.
The cheese will be served when I want it served.
I want it served now.
Are you frightened, child?
No need for that.
We’re only women here.
Tell us the truth.
No harm will come to you.
My father always told the truth.
Yes, he had that reputation.
And they named him traitor and took his head.
Joffrey.
Joffrey did that.
He promised he would be merciful and he cut my father’s head off.
And he said that was mercy.
Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it.
Go on.
I can’t.
I never meant…
My father was a traitor.
My brother as well.
I have traitor’s blood.
Please don’t make me say any more.
She’s terrified, Grandmother.
Look at her.
Speak freely, child.
We would never betray your confidence, I swear it.
He’s a monster.
Ah.
That’s a pity.
Please, don’t stop the wedding.
Have no fear.
The Lord Oaf of Highgarden is determined that Margaery shall be queen.
Even so, we thank you for the truth.
Ah.
Here comes my cheese.
We’re at war.
This march is a distraction.
My grandfather’s funeral is not a distraction.
Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?
No.
Then it’s a distraction.
My Uncle Edmure has his forces garrisoned there.
We need his men.
Unless he’s been breeding them, he don’t have enough to make a difference.
Have you lost faith in our cause?
If it’s revenge, I still got faith in it.
If you no longer believe…
I can believe till it snows in Dorne.
Don’t change the fact that we’ve got half the men.
You don’t think we can win?
May I speak my mind, Your Grace?
Have you not been speaking your mind, Lord Karstark?
I think you lost this war the day you married her.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Your Grace.
You’re afraid of her.
And she knows it.
I’m not afraid of her.
May I help you, Lady Stark?
No.
I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have…
You can’t help because a mother makes one for her children to protect them.
Only a mother can make them.
You’ve made them before?
Twice.
Did they work?
After a fashion.
I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall.
Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox.
Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he’d live.
But it would be a very long night.
So I sat with him all through the darkness.
Listened to his ragged little breaths.
His coughing, his whimpering.
Which boy?
Jon Snow.
When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldn’t bear to look at him.
I didn’t want to see those brown stranger’s eyes staring up at me.
So I prayed to the Gods, take him away.
Make him die.
He got the pox.
And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived.
A murderer.
I’d condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother.
A woman he didn’t even know.
So I prayed to all seven Gods, let the boy live.
Let him live and I’ll love him.
I’ll be a mother to him.
I’ll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us.
And he lived.
And he lived.
And I couldn’t keep my promise.
And everything that’s happened since then, all this horror that’s come to my family, it’s all because I couldn’t love a motherless child.
Was it hard for you to kill the Halfhand?
Yes.
You liked him?
I like you, but if you’re playing us false, it won’t be hard for me to kill you.
I’ve got wildling blood in my veins.
These are my people.
I understand.
Well, how could you understand?
You want to protect your people.
Do you know what it takes to unite clans, half of whom want to massacre the other half for one insult or another?
They speak seven different languages in my army.
The Thenns hate the Hornfoots.
The Hornfoots hate the iceriver clans.
Everyone hates the cave people.
So you know how I got moon worshippers and cannibals and giants to march together in the same army?
No.
I told them we were all going to die if we don’t get south.
Because that’s the truth.
Shouldn’t be long now.
What’s wrong with him?
He’s a warg.
He can enter the mind of animals, see through their eyes.
He’s scouting for us.
What, you’ve never met a warg?
Orell.
Where were you this time?
The Fist of the First Men.
What did you see?
Dead crows.
What’s the matter, Piggy?
You crying ’cause you’re cold?
There’s brothers killed by dead men and you’re still here whimpering.
That seem fair to you?
I seen ’em torn to pieces fighting while you was off somewhere hiding in a hole.
Why don’t you lie down and rest for a while, eh?
You know you want to.
Hey.
Get up, Sam.
No.
Get up.
I can’t.
If you stop, you’ll die.
‘Course if you don’t stop, you’ll probably die, too.
You don’t care.
‘Course we care.
You left me.
When the White Walkers came, you left me.
Aye, we left you.
You’re fat and you’re slow.
We didn’t want to die.
Help me get him up.
Looks like that piggy is done for.
Help us get him up.
He’s slowing us down.
Just get him up!
Why?
So the rest of us can die?
We’ll move faster without him.
What is this?
Get up, Tarly.
Is he all right?
Aye, I think so.
We may as well just go without him.
That’s enough.
Tarly, I forbid you to die.
Do you hear me?
Why should the rest of us…
Rast, you’re responsible for him.
What am I supposed to do?
Make sure he gets back alive.
If he doesn’t, you don’t.
Move on!
I’m not dying for you, Piggy.
You hear me?
Where’s Rickon and Hodor?
Looking for food.
What’s out there?
Not another step, boy.
Unless you want to drown in your own blood.
I’m unarmed.
That was poor planning.
My sister carries the weapons.
I’m better with them.
Drop the spear.
Drop it.
If you kill me, that wolf will tear you to bits.
You must be Summer.
I’m Jojen Reed.
This is my sister, Meera.
We’ve come a long way to find you, Brandon.
And we have much farther to go.
I’m just trying to understand.
Would you please shut up about it?
Jaqen H’ghar offered you three kills.
I’m not listening.
But just explain it to me.
He offered to kill any three people you wanted.
Dead.
All you had to do was give him the names.
Anyone.
You could have picked King Joffrey.
Shut up.
You could have picked Tywin Lannister.
Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal, so why are you complaining?
But you could have ended the war.
Where are we going?
North.
We should have come to the Red Fork River by now.
Maybe we passed it.
It’s feet wide.
How could we have passed it?
If we hit the Red Fork, we can follow it west to Riverrun.
My mother grew up there.
My grandfather’s a lord.
He’ll protect us.
Could be a minstrel.
Shut up.
A minstrel’s got gold sometimes.
We could jump him, tie him up, steal his gold, and buy some food.
Shh!
And so he spoke, and so he spoke That lord of Castamere But now the rains weep o’er his hall With no one there to hear What’s lurking behind that wall?
A lion?
A wolf?
Just a dirty little cub, I think.
Loose a few more shafts.
Don’t.
Put the sword down, girl.
You go on down the road.
Keep singing so we know where you are.
Leave us be and I won’t kill you.
Generous.
You’re a dangerous person.
I like dangerous people.
Why are your friends so shy?
What friends?
The fat one to your left and the lad beside him.
Three young ones on the run carrying castleforged swords.
You escape from Harrenhal?
Who are you?
Thoros of Myr.
The fellow with the bow is Anguy.
No, who do you fight for?
The Brotherhood Without Banners.
Now come along.
I want to hear how two boys and a very dangerous girl escaped Harrenhal.
I’m not going with them.
The Brotherhood?
That’s who the Mountain were looking for.
They’ll bring us back and put rats in us.
You’ve got nothing to fear from us.
The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside.
We’re trying to save it.
Now come on.
We’ll talk more over brown bread and stew.
And then you can go on your way.
Here’s the thing, fat boy.
When I’m done talking, that arrow’s falling down on your fat head.
So I advise you move, because I’m done talking.
Half the country’s starving and look at this one.
Maybe he’s the reason half the country’s starving.
My lion.
We’ve spoken of this.
You cannot come here.
But you said I should come to you with any problems.
Did anyone see you?
No.
You sure?
My father does not make idle threats.
Having you killed would be the high point of his week.
You have to be absolutely certain.
All right.
What is this problem?
I’m worried about Sansa.
When she spoke with Lord Baelish, his friend warned me about him.
Baelish doesn’t have friends.
I don’t know her name.
Oh, Ros?
The redhead?
How do you know her?
I try to know as many people as I can.
You never know which one you’ll need.
She’s a whore.
Yes, well, we shouldn’t be judgemental about these things.
You fucked her.
Oh, please.
All right, yes, I fucked her once.
Twice.
But since I met you, my lady, I’ve been with no one else.
And was she good?
Did you like her?
Not as much as I like you, obviously, or she’d be the one torturing me right now.
What did she say about Littlefinger?
That Sansa shouldn’t trust him.
Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?
We have to protect her.
We can’t.
Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors.
A great beauty with a very old name.
A great beauty?
Oh, a great beauty?
Yes, she is, objectively, very.
Her face is quite pleasing, to other men and to women, people in general.
But not to me, of course.
I only have eyes for you.
You pervert.
You want her?
This child?
I don’t even want to talk about her.
But you are.
Only because you’re making me.
I didn’t force you to open your mouth and make words come out.
This is cruel and unfair.
Cruelly unfair.
Aw!
“The cruelty.
Shae is so cruel to me.
” Mmm.
Yes.
Now do you think I’m cruel?
Only if you stop.
But you mustn’t come here again.
Do you hear me?
You’ve come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people.
Dangerous people.
Mmm.
Lady Tyrell, my king.
Send her in.
You wanted to see me, Your Grace?
I’m leaving on a hunting trip.
I just wanted to make sure you had everything you need before I left.
That’s very thoughtful, Your Grace.
I have everything I could want.
Good.
Good.
How are you finding life in the capital?
It must be quite a change after Renly’s camp.
A welcome one.
A military encampment is no place for a lady.
And the bedside of a traitor?
Is that a place for a lady?
Your Grace, I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all.
What was your duty to this traitor as you saw it?
The duty of any wife to any husband.
To provide him with children.
You failed to do this.
Why?
I…
I would not speak ill of the dead.
You think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor ’cause he had a sword put through his heart?
No.
I do beg your pardon.
The subtleties of politics are often lost on me.
Renly…
I don’t believe he was interested in the company of women.
What makes you say this?
Whenever I wanted to make a child with him, he…
He had so many excuses, so many latenight war councils.
He never wanted to try.
Except one evening, after he’d had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something…
Something that sounded very painful and couldn’t possibly result in children.
Maybe the fault was with me.
No, he was a known degenerate.
It’s such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace.
Mmm.
I’ve considered making his perversion punishable by death.
As is your right.
You must do whatever you need to do.
You are the king.
Yes.
I am.
Do you like it?
I just had it made.
Probably one of the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.
It’s beautiful.
Will you show me how it works?
It’s a new design.
Much easier to load.
There’s no crank.
You use this lever to draw the string.
The bolt goes here.
And then you just aim…
And…
Would you take me hunting sometime?
Forgive me, Your Grace.
I know a hunt is no place for a woman.
It’s not unheard of.
My father would never let me before…
You no longer belong to him.
Do you want to hold it?
May I?
Please.
I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there.
Could you do it?
Could you kill something?
I don’t know, Your Grace.
Do you think I could?
Yes.
Would you like to watch me?
Yes.
Stop!
Stop!
Tell us the truth.
About what?
I don’t know what you want.
I want the truth.
What truth?
Why’d you take Winterfell?
I took it to…
I took it…
Who gave the orders?
No one.
I took it on my own.
Why?
To take the North while vulnerable.
And once you took it?
Hold it.
Rule it.
Good.
That’s very good.
Why did you do that?
I told you.
Why did you take Winterfell?
I took it to bring glory to my house and my father.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
I took it because I hated the Starks.
I hated them for holding me prisoner.
I wanted to hurt them.
What are you doing?
Please.
I’ll tell you anything.
Just take it off.
Please.
Please, just take it off.
Your sister sent me.
Yara?
I’ll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps.
No, don’t go.
Please, please.
No, please don’t leave me.
Please, please.
Please, please don’t go!
Please.
Please.
Don’t leave me.
Please don’t go.
Rickon, stay with us.
It’s all right.
The wolves will protect him.
You can get inside his head, see through his eyes.
Only when I’m asleep.
That’s how it begins until you learn to control it.
You’re a warg.
It’s not just wolves.
Sometimes in my dreams there’s a…
A threeeyed raven?
You’ve seen it?
We saw him together.
You haven’t forgotten?
Does it have anything to do with warging?
No, the raven is something different, something deeper.
The raven brings the sight.
Seeing things that haven’t happened yet?
Or things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away.
What’s he telling him?
Why don’t you ask?
Isn’t he ashamed, your brother, needing you to protect him?
Where’s the shame in that?
Any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting.
Some people will always need help.
That doesn’t mean they’re not worth helping.
When my father died, I dreamt it.
You didn’t dream it.
You saw it.
So did I.
You have the sight, too?
When I told my father about your father, for the first time in my life, I saw him cry.
Your father is Howland Reed?
Yeah.
He saved my father’s life during the rebellion.
Your father told you about the rebellion?
Mine never did.
But I saw that, too.
What else have you seen?
Only one thing that matters, you.
I never liked the skinny ones.
Like drinking from a puddle.
Not that I’m averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again.
I don’t drink ale.
There’s no story so good a drink won’t make it better.
Yeah!
You see?
They’ve suffered through my bouts of sobriety.
It’s very tedious for all concerned.
Now, how did three children…
We’re not children.
How did three young persons such as yourselves, untrained in the art of war, escape from Harrenhal?
Gendry’s a smith.
He was apprenticed in the armoury.
A smith, eh?
Where’d you train?
King’s Landing.
Tobho Mott’s shop.
That criminal.
He charges twice as much as every other armourer in the city.
That’s because he’s twice as good.
Ahha!
A smith and a salesman.
Gendry stole us weapons.
Ah!
Fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see.
He knows how to use a sword and so do I.
My brothers taught me.
Ooh!
To your brothers!
You can finish your meals before you go.
It may be awhile before you see another.
You’ll free us?
I gave you my word.
But before you go, allow me to raise a cup to your…
Hey, hey.
Now that is an uncommonly large person.
How does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person?
One waits for him to drink until he passes out.
Poor man.
You have my sympathy.
Aha!
Not a man at all.
A Hound!
So good to see you again, Clegane.
Thoros?
The fuck you doing here?
Drinking and talking too much.
Same as ever.
A pretty prize, lads.
Yeah!
Girl.
What in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch?
It’s a tough decision.
Take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water.
Silence.
Anyone can see us on the bridge, but cross by water and the current could take us.
Or I could escape down the river.
Good luck.
It’s wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas.
Which will she choose?
Gambler at heart.
Wouldn’t have guessed.
Be quick about it.
Oh, I need to rest.
Get up.
I have these, on your feet when you walk too far.
What do you call them?
Get up now.
Corns.
I never used to get corns.
I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year.
This heel is ruined.
There’s no way…
I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords.
Ooh!
You move well for a great beast of a woman.
You shouldn’t grimace before you lunge.
It gives away the game.
Bit of a quandary for you.
If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark.
But if you don’t kill me, I’m going to kill you.
You’re good.
Graceless, but good.
See?
If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there.
Looks like your woman’s getting the better of you, if you can call that a woman.
We enjoy a good fight.
Gets our juices flowing.
The Flayed Man of House Bolton.
A bit gruesome for my taste.
You sure he’s the one?
That’s him, all right.
I saw him fight at the tourney for Ser Willem Frey’s wedding.
Give the man his silver.
Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want.
Enough to buy me a new head?
If the King in the North hears I let the Kingslayer go, he’ll be taking it right off.
I’d rather he takes yours.To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
If I may, nephew, I encountered a situation with one of my lieutenants at the Stone Mill which may have some bearing…
Why don’t you shut your mouth about that damned mill?
And don’t call him “nephew.
” He is your king.
Robb knows I meant him no…
You’re lucky I’m not your king.
I wouldn’t let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag.
My blunder sent Tywin’s mad dog back to Casterly Rock with his tail between his legs.
I think King Robb understands we won’t win this war if he’s the only one winning any battles.
No, there’s glory enough to go around.
It’s not about glory.
Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you.
I seized an opportunity.
What value was the mill?
The Mountain was garrisoned across the river from it.
Is he there now?
Of course not.
We took the fight to him.
He could not withstand us.
I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west, into our country, where we could surround him and kill him.
I wanted him to chase us, which he would have done because he is a mad dog without a strategic thought in his head.
I could have that head on a spike by now.
Instead, I have a mill.
We took hostages.
Willem Lannister.
Martyn Lannister.
Willem and Martyn Lannister are years old.
Martyn is , I believe.
Tywin Lannister has my sisters.
Have I sued for peace?
No.
Do you think he’ll sue for peace because we have his father’s brother’s greatgrandsons?
No.
How many men did you lose?
.
But for every man we lost, the Lannisters…
We need our men more than Tywin needs his!
I’m sorry.
I didn’t know.
You would have.
Right here today at this gathering, if you had been patient.
We seem to be running short of patience here.
You know who isn’t?
Tywin Lannister.
Intimate.
Lovely table.
Better chairs than the old Small Council chamber.
Conveniently close to your own quarters.
I like it.
What news of Jaime?
, unwashed Northerners have known about his escape for weeks.
You control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined.
Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is?
We are trying, my lord.
Try harder.
What do we have, then?
Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully.
In Stark’s absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, in practice, not in name.
Let him have it.
The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble.
The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.
For which I am extremely grateful to you, my lord.
Lady Arryn and I have known each other since we were children.
She has always been positively predisposed toward me.
A successful courtship would make Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale.
Titles do seem to breed titles.
You’ll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold.
Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him.
Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish’s absence would present certain problems.
The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory.
Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead.
Not a good time to leave the crown’s finances unattended.
Fully agreed.
Which is why I’m naming you new Master of Coin.
Master of Coin?
It would appear to best suits your talents.
I’m quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn’t taught me much about managing it.
I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge.
Hear, hear.
He lifted her high in the air He sniffed and roared and smelled her there She kicked and wailed, the maid so fair But he licked the honey from her hair From there to here, from here to there All black and brown and covered with hair He smelled that girl on the summer air The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair I hope you’re pleased.
If I were armed, they’d never have taken us.
You were armed when we were taken.
I was in chains, if you recall.
Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren’t bound.
All my life I’ve been hearing, “Jaime Lannister, “what a brilliant swordsman.
” You were slower than I expected.
And more predictable.
I’ve been sitting in a muddy pen, wrapped in chains, for the past year.
I’m a woman.
I was beating you.
You were not beating me.
Maybe you were as good as people said…
Once.
Or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name.
When we make camp tonight, you’ll be raped.
More than once.
None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman.
You’d be wise not to resist.
Would I?
They’ll knock your teeth out.
You think I care?
No, I don’t think you care about your teeth.
If you fight them, they will kill you.
Do you understand?
I’m the prisoner of value, not you.
Let them have what they want.
What does it matter?
What does it matter?
Close your eyes.
Pretend they’re Renly.
If you were a woman, you wouldn’t resist?
You’d let them do what they wanted?
If I was a woman, I’d make them kill me.
But I’m not, thank the Gods.
If I had a proper forge, I’d make it good as new.
Doesn’t have to look pretty.
It just has to keep the arrows out of my heart.
Why are you helping him?
He takes us prisoner, now he’s our friend?
You’re not our prisoner.
What am I?
Our guest.
No one’s put any chains on you.
So I can walk away, then?
These woods aren’t safe for Ned Stark’s daughter.
You’re lucky we found you.
You think you’re good with that bow, you little twat?
Better than anyone you’ve met.
A coward’s weapon.
I like to fight up close.
I like to see a man’s face when I put the steel in him.
Why?
So you can kiss him?
You remember the last time you were here?
Looks like every other shit inn on the road.
Now, apologies, but you’re one ugly fucker and I’d rather not see you no more.
Watch your head.
Off we go.
Walk up!
What are you doing?
We’re about to leave.
I’m staying.
You’re what?
I baked brown bread for the innkeep, she said she never had better.
Told Thoros she’s keeping me as payment for all his free meals.
Anyway, it’s not me the Brotherhood wants.
My brother ain’t no king.
I’m not a Stark of Winterhell.
Winterfell.
You sure?
I’m sure.
Well, I made you something.
What is it?
It’s a wolf.
Yes, it is.
That’s the tail?
Yeah.
Well, be safe.
Yeah, you, too.
Don’t get stabbed.
You don’t burn your fingers.
Goodbye, Hot Pie.
Goodbye, Arry.
Up you go, little lady.
Hey, Hot Pie.
It’s really good.
A person could almost be forgiven for forgetting we’re at war.
It often comforts me to think that even in war’s darkest days, in most places in the world absolutely nothing is happening.
I’ve missed you, Uncle.
Father missed you, too, from the day you left.
Maybe he never said it in so many words…
Maybe?
Your father was a stubborn old ox.
I was surprised when he died.
Didn’t think death had the patience.
I’m glad you were with him.
I wish to the Gods I had been.
Did you make peace in the end?
After years of fighting, I don’t think he remembered what started it.
He asked me to stop calling myself Blackfish.
He said it was an old joke and it was never funny to begin with.
I told him people had been calling me Blackfish for so long, they don’t remember my real name.
Every time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign, I’d see him off.
“Wait for me, little Cat,” he’d say.
“Wait for me, and I’ll come back to you.
” And I would sit at this window every day when the sun came up, waiting.
I wonder, how many times did Bran or Rickon stare across the moors of Winterfell, waiting for me to return?
I will never see them again.
You mustn’t think it.
We don’t know the truth.
They could be in hiding.
Robb believes they’re alive.
And he must go on believing.
He’s got to remain strong if he’s to prevail.
And you must remain strong for him.
You’re Robb Stark’s wife.
Hold still.
Is it true what they say about him?
I don’t know.
What do they say about him?
That he can turn into a wolf at night.
True.
And he eats the flesh of his enemies.
True.
You’re a Lannister, aren’t you?
Martyn Lannister.
Martyn Lannister.
You’ve nothing to fear.
My husband doesn’t eat children.
Unless it’s a full moon.
It’s not a full moon tonight, is it?
See?
Nothing to fear.
Always the artists.
It’s only horses.
No men.
You said there was dead crows.
There was.
How many men were here?
About .
And you know what those men are now?
We’re all the same to them, meat for their army.
Do you think anyone got away?
It’s not impossible.
You don’t go far betting against Mormont.
But dead or alive, he took a big gamble coming north.
And he lost.
His best fighting men are dead.
And whether he’s Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch or a blueeyed corpse, he’s a long way from home.
Tormund.
Climb the Wall.
Take Orell and good men.
And take this one.
He knows Castle Black’s defences better than any of us.
And if he’s useful, good.
If not, throw him off the Wall.
See if crows can fly.
We’re finally going to war, old friend?
Hide near Castle Black.
When I give the signal, hit them in the night.
They’ve got a big old wall to hide behind, but it only guards one side.
We’ll meet again.
Aye.
If you do your job.
Ah.
How will we see your signal?
Send your eagle above the Wall every night.
When it’s time, I’m going to light the biggest fire the North has ever seen.
Ghost?
What have we here?
Frozen crows?
We’ve come a long way.
Smaller flock than you went north with.
We can talk inside.
Oh, can we?
They need some water.
Tether it, and I’ll be inside.
Keep your eyes where they belong.
They’re not for you.
Bet you feed that pig better than you feed us.
Aye, pig’s got value to me.
You should all be kissing my feet for letting you in.
I’d have turned you all away if I wasn’t a godly man.
You are a godly man?
I am.
I got no fear of what’s out there.
When the white cold comes, your swords and cloaks and bloody fires won’t help you.
The only ones left will be those who are right with the Gods.
The real Gods.
Go tell her she can bite down on a rag or she can bite down on my fist.
Women.
That sow right there gave birth to a litter of eight.
Barely a grunt.
And she’s almost as fat as this one here.
Now why don’t you dine on him?
Carve off what you need as you go.
Well, look at him.
He’s a walking feast.
Here we are.
Sharpen these for me, would ya?
I see the head.
Push.
That’s it.
You’re nearly there.
One more push should do it.
What is it?
What is it?
Keep quiet.
If you can’t ride, we don’t stand a chance.
I can ride.
You’re sure?
Ride east.
Follow the rising sun.
Your sister’s waiting for you.
I’ll make you a Lord of the Iron Islands for this.
We’re not in the Iron Islands.
Go.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on back.
You refuse to tell me where you’re going?
I don’t know yet.
The fires will show me.
How long will you be gone?
I don’t know.
You’re abandoning me.
I will never abandon you.
You are the Son of Fire.
I am sworn to serve you.
Then serve me.
When I return, you will understand.
My enemies think they’ve destroyed me.
They’re laughing at me, the way Renly laughed at me.
I want Joffrey dead.
I want Robb Stark dead.
Make me another son.
I cannot.
Why?
You don’t have the strength.
It would kill you.
I’m not easily killed.
Men have tried for years.
I want you.
Your fires burn low, my king.
There is another way.
A better way.
You told me your magic requires a king’s blood.
Yes.
I’m the one true king.
You are.
There are others with your blood in their veins.
You will sit on the Iron Throne, but first there must be sacrifices.
The Lord of Light demands it.
The Walk of Punishment is a warning, Your Grace.
To whom?
To any slave who contemplates doing whatever these slaves did.
Give me your water.
Khaleesi, this man has been sentenced to death.
Here, drink.
Leave this place, Your Grace.
Leave tonight, I beg you.
And what is she to do for soldiers?
We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr.
Is it “we” already, Ser Barristan?
If you want to sit on the throne your ancestors built, you must win it.
That means blood on your hands before the thing is done.
The blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents.
How many wars have you fought in, Ser Barristan?
Three.
Have you ever seen a war where innocents didn’t die by the thousands?
I was in King’s Landing after the sack, Khaleesi.
You know what I saw?
Butchery.
Babies, children, old men.
More women raped than you can count.
There’s a beast in every man, and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand.
But the Unsullied are not men.
They do not rape.
They do not put cities to the sword unless they’re ordered.
If you buy them, the only men they’ll kill are those you want dead.
You disagree, Ser Barristan?
When your brother led his army into battle at the Trident, men died for him because they believed in him, because they loved him, not because they’d been bought at an auction.
I fought beside the last dragon on that day.
I bled beside him.
Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, and Rhaegar died.
Did you know him well, Ser Barristan?
I did, Your Grace.
Finest man I ever met.
I wish I had known him.
But he was not the last dragon.
All?
Did this one’s ears mishear, Your Grace?
They did not.
I want to buy them all.
She wants to buy them all.
She can’t afford them.
The slut thinks she can flash her tits, and make us give her whatever she wants.
There are , Unsullied in Astapor.
Is this what you mean by all?
Yes.
,.
And the ones still in training as well.
If they fail on the battlefield, they will shame Astapor.
Master Greizhen says they cannot sell halftrained boys.
If they fail on the battlefield, they will bring shame upon all of Astapor.
I will have them all or take none.
Many will fall in battle.
I’ll need the boys to pick up the swords they drop.
The slut cannot pay for all of this.
Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this.
Her ship will buy her Unsullied, no more, Your ship will buy you Unsullied.
and this because I like the curve of her ass.
Because Master Kraznys is generous.
What is left will buy her .
The gold you have left is worth .
I will give her if it stops her ignorant whimpering.
But good Master Kraznys will give you .
Her Dothraki smell of shit, The Dothraki you have with you…
but may be useful as pig feed.
The Dothraki you have are not worth what they cost to feed…
I will give her for those.
but Master Kraznys will give you three Unsullied for all of them.
So, ask this beggar queen, Master Kraznys asks how you propose to pay…
how will she pay for the remaining ,?
for the remaining , Unsullied?
I have dragons.
I’ll give you one.
You will win the throne with dragons, not slaves, Your Grace.
Khaleesi, please.
Three dragons.
One.
Two.
One.
They want the biggest one.
Done.
Done.
I’ll take you as well, now.
You’ll be Master Kraznys’ gift to me.
A token of a bargain well struck.
She asks that you give me to her, as a present.
She asks that you do this now.
Khaleesi, a dragon is worth more than any army.
Aegon Targaryen proved that.
You’re both here to advise me.
I value your advice, but if you ever question me in front of strangers again, you’ll be advising someone else.
Is that understood?
Do you have a name?
This one’s name is Missandei, Your Grace.
Do you have a family?
A mother and a father you’d return to if you had the choice?
No, Your Grace.
No family living.
You belong to me now.
It is your duty to tell me the truth.
Yes, Your Grace.
Lying is a great offence.
Many of those on the Walk of Punishment were taken there for less.
I offered water to a slave dying on the Walk of Punishment.
Do you know what he said to me?
“Let me die.
” There are no masters in the grave, Your Grace.
Is it true what Master Kraznys told me about the Unsullied?
About their obedience?
All questions have been taken from them.
They obey, that is all.
Once they are yours, they are yours.
They will fall on their swords if you command it.
And what about you?
You know that I’m taking you to war.
You may go hungry.
You may fall sick.
You may be killed.
Valar Morghulis.
Yes, all men must die.
But we are not men.
A surprising place to keep the royal ledgers.
I’m surprised you’re surprised.
This is the safest place in the city.
Not for bastards.
That’s all of them, my lord.
Thank you, my dear.
Pod.
Pod.
Take them outside.
I’ll be there in a moment.
Yes, my lord.
I hear you owe that boy a significant debt.
Only my life.
Not all that significant, I’m afraid.
You should have him knighted.
If only the Master of Coin had such power.
If only.
I owe you a significant debt.
Our redheaded friend.
You secured her release when the Queen detained her.
Oh, that.
Of course.
A simple misunderstanding.
Apparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship.
We don’t.
I did fuck her once.
I know.
But we don’t.
I know.
How’d the Queen get that idea?
Why don’t you ask her?
Any advice for me on my new position?
Keep a low profile.
If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, I’d be richer than you are.
Well, you are richer than I am.
Good point.
They’re only numbers.
Numbers on paper.
Once you understand that, it’s easy to make them behave.
Trivial even.
You want a real challenge?
Try whores.
I’ve tried quite a few.
Well, lots of work to do.
Enjoy the Eyrie.
Come on, I’m here later.
Come on.
Tonight, then.
Looks like dull reading.
You think all reading is dull reading.
It’s an opinion I share with some of the finest men I know.
The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is in these pages.
Unless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what he’s really up to.
Unless he made it all up, yes.
Podrick, do keep up.
Yes, my lord.
Podrick.
Yes, my lord?
After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn, I finally found a suitable reward for the services you’ve provided over and above what might be considered reasonable.
Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman?
No, my lord.
Wonderful.
Genna specialises in firsttimers.
She’s not bad with secondtimers, either.
Uh, my lord…
A fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my wouldbe killer’s face, wouldn’t you say?
Now, as it happens, Marei is quite the spearhandler herself.
She’s here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me.
He’s handsome.
You didn’t tell me he was handsome.
Kayla is famous from here to Volantis in certain circles.
One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot.
My lord, I don’t even…
She’s here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow, who’s never once failed to address me as “my lord.
” Be back in time for my supper.
Pace yourself, lad.
For years I’ve heard that Littlefinger is a magician.
Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together and, poof, mountains of gold.
Let me guess.
He’s not a magician.
No.
He’s stealing it?
Worse, he’s borrowing it.
What’s wrong with that?
We can’t afford to pay it back, that’s what’s wrong with it.
The crown owes millions to my father.
Seeing as it’s his grandson’s ass on the throne, I imagine he’ll forgive that debt.
Forgive a debt, my father?
For a man of the world, you’re strangely naive.
I’ve never borrowed money.
I’m not clear on the rules.
Well…
The basic principle is, I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest.
What if I don’t?
Well, you have to.
But what if I don’t?
This is why I don’t lend you money.
Anyway, it’s not my father I’m worried about.
It’s the Iron Bank of Braavos.
We owe them tens of millions.
If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies.
One way or another, they always get their gold back.
Ah, the return of the conquering hero.
Does he have a little jaunt in his step?
The lad’s practically skipping.
You were gone a long time.
I trust you got your money’s worth.
Or should I say my money’s worth?
Oh, it was a gift, Podrick.
This is more than I give you in a year.
He’s a squire.
You don’t pay him.
Oh, then it’s much more than I give you in a year.
They wouldn’t take it, my lord.
Maybe they’re trying to curry some favour with the new Master of Coin.
Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold?
They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them.
What did you tell them?
I didn’t tell them anything.
What did you do to them?
Lots of things.
And they seemed to like these things?
Yes, my lord.
Of course they did.
They’re paid to seem to like it.
Only they weren’t paid.
What are you saying?
These ladies enjoyed him so much, they gave him the time for free?
Is that what you’re telling us?
Sit down, Podrick.
We’re going to need details.
Copious details.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on.
You know how we deal with runaways?
Take off his pants.
No!
No!
No, no, no!
I’m gonna fuck you into the dirt.
No, please!
No, no, no!
No, don’t!
No, please!
No!
No!
You little bastard.
Come, my lord.
You’re a long way from home, and winter is coming.
I’ll take the big bitch first.
When she’s good and wet, you lot can finish her off.
My lord, I am Brienne of Tarth.
Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me to deliver Ser Jaime to King’s Landing.
Catelyn Stark’s a treasonous cunt.
Orders were to take the Kingslayer alive.
Nobody said shit about you.
You’re only making it worse.
Take her over there, where it’s dark.
I’d like a little privacy.
Come on!
You know who she is, don’t you?
A big dumb bitch from who cares where.
Never been with a woman that big.
She’s Brienne of Tarth.
Her father is Lord Selwyn Tarth.
Heard of Tarth?
I’m gonna cut your throat!
They call it the Sapphire Isle.
Do you know why?
Every sapphire in Westeros was mined on Tarth.
Sapphires are gemstones.
The blue ones.
I know what they are.
Lord Selwyn would pay his daughter’s weight in sapphires if she’s returned to him.
But only if she’s alive, her honour unbesmirched.
Bring her back here.
Yes, my lord.
Get up.
Come on.
Come on, on your feet.
Unbesmirched.
Not defiled.
Fancy word for a fancy man.
I hated to read as a child, but my father forced me to study every morning before I could practise with sword or horse.
Two hours every day holed up in the maester’s chambers.
I learned a lot of fancy words.
I bet you did.
Your father, he’d pay your weight in gold to get you back?
You’ll be a rich man till the end of your days.
And your sons will be rich men, and their sons after them.
Lands, titles…
You’ll have them all.
The North can’t win this war.
You’re a smart man.
You understand that.
We have the numbers.
We have the gold.
Aye, you have both.
Fighting bravely for a losing cause is admirable.
Fighting for a winning cause is far more rewarding.
Hard to argue with that.
Now that we’re speaking together man to man, I wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree?
I’m not asking to be freed from my constraints, but if I could sleep lying down, my back would thank you for it.
I’m not as young and resilient as I was once.
None of us are.
Unchain Ser Jaime from the tree.
Come on, men.
Suppose you’ll be wanting something to eat.
I’m famished, actually.
I think we’ve got a spare partridge on the fire.
Well, I do like partridge.
Bring the bird over here and the carving knife.
Will this work as a table, my lord?
Oh, yes.
Yes, this will do…
On the stump.
You think you’re the smartest man there is.
That everyone alive has to bow and scrape and lick your boots.
My father…
And if you get in any trouble, all you’ve got to do is say “my father” and that’s it, all your troubles are gone.
Don’t.
Have you got something to say?
Careful.
You don’t want to say the wrong thing.
You’re nothing without your daddy, and your daddy ain’t here.
Never forget that.
Here, this should help you remember.To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
How many of those fingers do you think we could shove up his ass?
Depends if he’s had any practice.
That the sort of thing you and your sister go in for?
She loosened you up for us?
He’s going to fall.
He’s going to fall off his horse.
Help him.
Water.
Water.
Please, water.
Water.
Water, please.
Please.
Please.
If I die, you won’t be getting…
Oh, enough.
Here.
Can’t say that I’ve ever seen a man drink horse piss that fast.
Stop!
Far enough.
Do that again and I’ll take your other hand.
Come on, you.
Oh, Lord Tyrion.
Come in, come in.
I hope we might speak in confidence.
Oh.
Always in confidence.
About the events of the Blackwater.
Perhaps this is the wrong time?
Oh, no, it’s a wonderful time.
I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister’s intentions to…
End your life?
I didn’t inherit Littlefinger’s spies along with his position, I’m afraid.
Which is why I’m coming to you.
I need proof.
Proof?
Will there be a trial?
I need to know.
I have no proof, only whispers.
Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut.
Do you want to hear it still?
I don’t know.
Do I?
As a boy, I travelled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities.
One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse.
I feared the man meant to use me as I’d heard some men used small boys.
But what he wanted was far worse.
He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses.
With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while.
He burned my parts in a brazier.
The flames turned blue, and I heard a voice answer his call.
I still dream of that night.
Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade.
I dream of the voice from the flames.
Was it a god?
A demon?
A conjuror’s trick?
I don’t know.
But the sorcerer called and a voice answered.
And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it.
But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his red priestess.
A symbolic revenge of sorts.
Yes.
I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed, which will require a degree of influence, which…
You do not possess at the moment.
But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found.
Once I had served the sorcerer’s purpose, he threw me out of his house to die.
I resolved to live to spite him.
I begged.
I sold what parts of my body remained to me.
I became an excellent thief, and soon learned that the contents of a man’s letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse.
Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the Small Council chamber.
Influence grows like a weed.
I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world, where I managed to wrap them around something very special.
Ugh.
The sorcerer.
Hello, my old friend.
It’s been a long time.
I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time, if you have the stomach for it.
When people talk about the Night’s Watch, they never mention the shovelling.
Or the shit.
They tell you about honour, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shovelling really is most of it.
And getting attacked or killed or worse.
And that.
But when you’re not getting attacked or killed, usually you’re shovelling.
Ah, look.
More shit.
I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of me day.
We need to get out of here.
When the Lord Commander says we go, we go.
The Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men.
How’d that turn out for us?
He had no way of knowing.
We do now.
We know what’s out there.
Craster’s been out here surviving.
So he’s your new protector now?
Our good friend Craster?
We’re like the sons he never had.
Mormont isn’t gonna save you.
This lummox here isn’t gonna save you.
When the Walkers come calling, Craster will serve us up like so many pigs.
If we want to live, we’ll have to look out for ourselves.
You woke him.
I’m sorry.
He’s beautiful.
Shh!
He’s beautiful.
Does he have a name?
No.
Are you going to give him one?
Why?
Here.
Gilly.
You said to hold it for you until you came back.
You’re back.
I wanted you to have it.
I don’t want your stupid thimble.
I want to save my baby’s life.
Can you do that?
Can you?
I don’t have time for you.
I don’t have time for anyone but him because he doesn’t have much time.
You have to go after him.
How?
You know how.
Brandon.
Mother.
How many times have I told you?
No climbing.
Mother, I need to find it.
It’s here.
It’s calling me.
I want you to promise me.
No more climbing.
Promise me.
Promise me!
Promise me!
Mother!
Mother!
Promise me, Bran!
Promise me!
Is he very large?
No larger than usual, apparently.
And yet, they said that he was…
Extraordinary.
The most extraordinary man they’ve ever had.
And they’ve had a lot of men.
We’re talking about the same Podrick?
The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion’s service?
Seems a bit simple?
What did he do to them?
I don’t know, my lord.
The girls are usually quite descriptive.
So what did they say?
They said it was hard to describe.
Huh.
Prodigies appear in the oddest of places.
And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?
He was too preoccupied to notice.
He’s leaving for the Eyrie soon.
I’m helping him prepare for his journey.
Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her.
Sad, really.
Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?
He hasn’t spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know.
Hmm.
But I don’t think he’s lost interest.
What makes you say so?
His shipboard inventory.
You can read.
Rare for a woman in your profession.
Former profession.
Of course.
I’m missing something obvious you’re about to point out?
Two featherbeds.
He’s bringing two featherbeds for the cabin.
Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed, besides Littlefinger?
Could he be bringing one of his girls?
He’s not interested in them, my lord.
How do you know?
Because I’m one of his girls.
Prodigies in odd places indeed.
Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered by her brother, or rather, his dragon.
It ate her while her son watched.
What’s left of her is buried in the crypts right down there.
The ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum, which seats comfortably.
There appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere on the premises for everyone else.
There aren’t more than people of any importance.
No, the rest are there to look adoringly upon the to remind them how superior they must be to have the best seats.
Over there, in that urn, the ashes of Aerion Targaryen.
Aerion Brightflame, they called him.
He thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon.
He was wrong.
And, of course, there’s the Mad King, killed by my uncle.
Would you like to see where the last Targaryens are buried?
Are you sure Lady Margaery doesn’t find all this a bit macabre?
No, it’s quite all right, Your Grace.
I’d love to see their tombs, really.
It’s like taking a walk through history.
The tomb’s just up here.
This is so exciting.
You were married here, Your Grace?
Yes.
Must seem like only yesterday.
Hmm.
Seems like a lifetime ago.
Your husband was buried here as well?
No, he wanted his remains returned to Storm’s End.
Such a tragedy.
A fairly predictable tragedy.
Hunting and drinking don’t mix.
I should say not.
My son’s a hunter.
It helps him forget he’s never been within a mile of a real battle.
I seem to recall he laid siege to Storm’s End for the better part of a year.
All he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent.
I told him to stay out of Robert’s Rebellion.
He had no business fighting an actual warrior.
We mothers do what we can to keep our sons from the grave.
But they do seem to yearn for it.
We shower them with good sense, and it slides right off, like rain off a wing.
And yet the world belongs to them.
A ridiculous arrangement, to my mind.
The Gods have seen fit to make it so.
My father didn’t want them here.
He was going to have their bodies burned and thrown in the Blackwater, but the High Septon convinced him otherwise.
I’m glad he did.
I’m sorry, Your Grace.
I know they did terrible things at the end, but their ancestors built this.
Sometimes severity is the price we pay for greatness.
I couldn’t agree more.
Shall we go and see them?
If you give them your love, they will return it a thousand fold.
I’ve spoken with them.
I know how they feel about you.
You led the defence of King’s Landing.
They adore you.
Open the doors.
Joffrey.
Wait.
Lady Margaery!
Lady Margaery!
Bless you, Lady Margaery!
Lady Margaery!
Lady Margaery!
Margaery!
Long live Lady Margaery!
King Joffrey!
King Joffrey!
King Joffrey!
King Joffrey!
King Joffrey!
Gods bless King Joffrey!
How far is it to Deepwood Motte?
Not far, my lord.
Your sister is waiting for you there.
She sent you to save me?
Yes.
I served them, the men who were torturing you.
I did what they told and waited.
Why would you risk your life for me?
I grew up on Saltcliffe, my lord.
I was only a boy when they took you away.
My father brought us up to the bluffs so we could watch you carried off.
I remember the look on my father’s face when he told us, “That’s Balon Greyjoy’s last living son.
” And those are the words I heard over again when I saw what they were doing to you.
Those men, they said my father knew what they were doing to me.
Did he?
I don’t know, my lord.
They…
They never told me much.
My sister’s men are loyal to her.
We don’t need to hide from them.
Not all those are your sister’s men.
Some of them are loyal to your father.
Hmm.
What is it?
I was just thinking how jealous I was when my father told Yara to take this place.
What did he tell you to do?
Raid fishing villages.
He didn’t trust me.
Thought I was a Stark.
I could never be a Stark.
Robb Stark always reminded me of that.
He lorded it over you?
Didn’t have to.
All he had to do was be.
Be who he was born to be.
His life fit him better than his clothes.
How could someone like that ever be a brother to me?
He’s the King in the North.
And me…
My father gave me a choice and I made it.
I could never be a Stark.
But ironborn, that’s what I was born to be.
I paid the iron price for Winterfell.
I murdered those boys.
The Stark boys?
Never found them.
Just some poor orphans living with a farmer.
I let Dagmer slit their throats and I let him burn the bodies, so I could keep Winterfell and make my father proud.
Maybe it’s not too late.
It is.
My real father lost his head at King’s Landing.
I made a choice, and I chose wrong.
And now I’ve burned everything down.
Not everything, my lord.
She’s up here.
Yara.
Shh!
Wait.
I brought him back.
He…
He killed the others.
What?
No, I didn’t.
You can’t!
No!
Please, stop!
No!
Put him back where he belongs.
Eat.
What are you doing?
I’m dying.
You can’t die.
You need to live to take revenge.
I don’t care about revenge.
You coward.
A little misfortune and you’re giving up.
Misfor…
Misfortune?
You lost your hand.
My sword hand.
I was that hand.
You have a taste, one taste of the real world where people have important things taken from them, and you whine and cry and quit.
You sound like a bloody woman.
I know what you did for me.
You told them Tarth was full of sapphires.
It’s called the Sapphire Isle because of the blue of its water.
You knew that.
Why did you help me?
You wanted to speak to me?
Yes, about Jaime.
What about him?
I wanted to make sure we’re doing everything we can to get him back.
When Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner, what did I do in response?
You started a war.
And if I would start a war for that lecherous little stump, what do you think I am doing for my oldest son and heir?
Whatever you can.
Whatever I can.
You’re still here.
Yes.
Why?
Did it ever occur to you that I might be the one who deserves your confidence and your trust, not your sons?
Not Jaime or Tyrion, but me.
Years and years of lectures on family and legacy…
The same lecture, really, just with tiny, tedious variations.
Did it ever occur to you that your daughter might be the only one listening to them, living by them?
That she might have the most to contribute to your legacy that you love so much more than your actual children?
All right.
Contribute.
The Tyrells are a problem.
The Tyrells helped us defeat Stannis Baratheon.
The Tyrells saved your life, your children’s lives.
Margaery has her claws in Joffrey.
She knows how to manipulate him.
Good.
I wish you knew how to manipulate him.
I don’t distrust you because you’re a woman.
I distrust you because you’re not as smart as you think you are.
You’ve allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you and everyone else in this city.
Perhaps you should try stopping him from doing what he likes.
I will.
Do you like it, Nana?
Another golden rose.
How original.
I eat from plates stamped with roses.
I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses.
I have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot, as if that makes it smell any better.
Roses are boring, dear.
“Growing strong.
” Ha!
The dullest words of any house.
“Winter is coming!
” Now that’s memorable.
“We do not sow.
” Strong.
Strong.
Those are houses you watch out for.
Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts.
But a golden rose growing strong, that strikes fear in the heart.
Look, little loves.
A spider in the garden.
Run along now.
Grow strong.
My lady.
I wanted to personally welcome you to King’s Landing.
The city has been made brighter by your presence.
The city is made brighter by my presence?
Is that your usual line, Lord Varys?
Are you here to seduce me?
A little obvious, perhaps.
Oh, no, please.
Seduce away.
It’s been so long.
Though I rather think it’s all for naught.
What happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit?
A question for the philosophers.
But you’ve come mincing all this way for something.
So?
Might I sit?
No.
Come, I’ve heard you’re such a clever man.
I’m curious why you’ve sought me out.
You’ve taken an interest in Sansa Stark.
Have I?
Because I spoke to her once in this garden and one of your little spies came running to tell you?
Why shouldn’t I?
She’s an interesting girl.
Is she?
No, not particularly.
But she’s had an interesting childhood.
She has, sadly.
Well, forgive me for wasting your time, then.
I thought we shared certain hopes for her wellbeing.
Come, come.
You surrender rather easily.
Walk with me.
I know the walls have ears, but apparently the shrubbery does, too.
I choose my allies carefully, and my enemies more carefully still.
Which is Sansa Stark?
Neither.
A babe in the woods.
I admired her father.
Yes.
Ned Stark had many admirers, and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head?
I could not help Lord Stark.
Perhaps I can help his daughter.
How?
You’re not the only one who has taken an interest in her.
That’s hardly surprising.
She’s a beautiful girl with a famous name.
Indeed.
She’d make a lovely match for the right suitor.
It almost feels as if you’re about to arrive at the point.
Littlefinger is not long for the capital.
A confidant of mine has told me that when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him.
And why have you come to me with this matter?
Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies.
He has acquired the first two.
How long before he has the army?
Perhaps you’ll laugh, but I know him better than most, and this is the truth.
Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros.
If Robb Stark falls, Sansa Stark is the key to the North.
And if he marries her, he’ll have the key in his pocket.
Which seems such a shame.
Why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride?
You must despise him.
You’re working so hard to undermine him.
Actually, I rather enjoy him.
But he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes.
You are a clever man, Lord Varys.
You are too kind.
I believe I have a possible solution.
One doesn’t need to be clever for that.
It’s obvious, isn’t it?
I didn’t mean to disturb you.
You haven’t.
We’d like some privacy, please.
If you wouldn’t mind waiting back inside the keep.
Or if you’d be kind enough to give me your names, I’ll ask the King to speak with you himself.
What did you pray for?
I can’t tell you.
Why not?
I’ll tell you what I prayed for in the Sept this morning.
Let’s see, for my family’s health and happiness, for an end to the war, for a short winter.
Boring and traditional, I’m afraid.
And you?
I’m sorry, I just can’t.
My cousin Alanna was the most beautiful girl I’d ever seen.
When I was , I was all elbows and knees, and Alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me.
“Pig Face,” she called me.
“Pig Face”?
That’s ridiculous.
It had something to do with my nose.
Whenever she passed me in the halls, she’d oink.
So I prayed that she’d catch a horrible skin disease.
A week after that, she came down with porridge plague.
Porridge plague?
Oh, you don’t have it in the North?
Your skin starts to look like boiled oats, and eventually, your face slides off and you die in agony.
But that’s awful.
You’re…
I believed you!
Porridge plague.
I’m an idiot.
Don’t say that.
No, you’re not.
So what happened to Alanna?
Oh, she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea.
It’s all terribly frustrating.
I’m sure she’s jealous of you now.
You’ll be married here in the capital, and she’ll have to come watch and pretend to be happy that you’re queen.
I want us to be friends, good friends.
That would make me very happy.
You must see Highgarden.
You’d love it there.
I know you would.
We have a great masquerade the night of the harvest moon.
You should see the costumes.
People work on them for months.
Uh, I don’t think the Queen would let me leave King’s Landing.
The Queen Regent, you mean.
Once I marry Joffrey, I’ll be queen.
And if you were to marry Loras, your place would be at Highgarden, wouldn’t it?
We would be sisters, you and I.
Would you like that?
His name was Bannen.
He was a good man, a good ranger.
He came to us from…
Where did he come from?
Down White Harbor way.
He came to us from White Harbor.
Never failed in his duty.
He kept his vows the best he could.
He rode far, fought fiercely.
We shall never see his like again.
And now his watch has ended.
And now his watch has ended.
Didn’t think a broke foot could kill a man.
It wasn’t his foot that killed him.
That bastard Craster starved him to death.
Craster’s got his daughters to feed.
You on his side?
We can’t just show up and steal all his food.
We’re brothers of the Night’s Watch, not thieves.
The day we leave, Craster will tap a barrel of our wine, and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes and laugh at us starving in the snow.
He’s a bloody wildling.
Never knew Bannen could smell so good.
You have one son, don’t you, Mormont?
I had my th.
You ever meet a man with sons?
And more daughters than I can count.
I’m glad for you.
Are you now?
Me, I’ll be glad when you and yours have gone.
As soon as our wounded are strong enough.
Ah!
They’re as strong as they’re gonna get.
Them that’s dying, why don’t you cut their throats and be done with it?
Or leave them if you’ve not the stomach, and I’ll sort them myself.
Whose throat you gonna cut, old man?
Wait outside.
It’s cold outside and there’s nothing to eat.
My wives gave you bread.
There’s sawdust in the bread.
You don’t like it, you go out there and eat the snow.
I’d rather eat what you’ve got hidden away.
I told you to wait outside.
He’s sitting there drinking our wine, eating his fill while we die.
I gave you crows enough.
I’ve got to feed my women!
You admit you’ve got a hidden larder?
How else you make it through winter?
Enough!
Out!
I am a godly man.
You’re a stingy bastard!
Bastard?
Out with you, you little thief.
And you!
And you!
Go sleep in the cold on empty bellies.
I’ll chop the hands off the next man who calls me bastard.
You are a bastard.
A daughterfucking, wildling bastard.
The Gods will curse us for this.
By all the laws…
There are no laws beyond the Wall.
Show us where he hides the food, or you’ll get the same as him.
Unhand her.
I shall have your head for this.
Quickly.
Quickly.
What’s happening?
I’m not going out there.
No, we have to go.
Now!
Follow me.
I know the best way.
Come on.
Run fast, Piggy, and sleep well!
I’ll be cutting your throat one of these nights.
Can I take this hood off yet?
I do apologise, little lady, but it’s better for you if you don’t see where we’re going.
Halt!
What is it?
Blackstrap rum.
Ugh!
Not easy finding molasses in wartime.
I’d have some.
Let’s go home.
What is this place?
Somewhere neither wolves nor lions come prowling.
You look like a bunch of swineherds.
Some of us were swineherds.
And some of us tanners and masons.
That was before.
You’re still swineherds and tanners and masons.
You think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier?
No.
Fighting in a war makes you a soldier.
Beric Dondarrion?
You’ve seen better days.
And I won’t see them again.
Stark deserters.
Baratheon deserters.
You lot aren’t fighting in a war, you’re running from it.
Last I heard, you were King Joffrey’s guard dog.
But here you are , miles from home.
Which of us is running?
Untie these ropes and we’ll find out.
What are you doing leading a mob of peasants?
Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother in King Robert’s name.
Ned Stark is dead.
King Robert is dead.
My brother’s alive.
You’re fighting for ghosts.
That’s what we are, ghosts waiting for you in the dark.
You can’t see us, but we see you.
No matter whose cloak you wear, Lannister, Stark, Baratheon, you prey on the weak, the Brotherhood Without Banners will hunt you down.
You found god?
Is that it?
Aye.
I’ve been reborn in the light of the one true god.
As have we all.
As would any man who’s seen the things we’ve seen.
If you mean to murder me, then get on with it.
You’ll die soon enough, dog.
But it won’t be murder, only justice.
And a kinder fate than you deserve.
Lions, you call yourselves.
At the Mummer’s Ford, girls of seven years were raped, and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched.
I wasn’t at the Mummer’s Ford.
Dump your dead children at some other door.
House Clegane was built upon dead children.
I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne.
Do you take me for my brother?
Is being born Clegane a crime?
Murder is a crime.
I never touched the Targaryen babes.
I never saw them, never smelt them, never heard them bawling.
You want to cut my throat, get on with it!
But don’t call me murderer and pretend that you’re not.
You murdered Mycah.
The butcher’s boy.
My friend.
He was years old.
He was unarmed.
And you rode him down.
You slung him over your horse like he was some deer.
Aye, he was a bleeder.
You don’t deny killing this boy?
I was Joffrey’s sworn shield.
The boy attacked the prince.
That’s a lie!
I hit Joffrey.
Mycah just ran away.
Then I should have killed you.
Not my place to question princes.
You stand accused of murder.
But no one here knows the truth of the charge, so it is not for us to judge you.
Only the Lord of Light may do that now.
I sentence you to trial by combat.
So, who will it be?
Should we find out if your fire god really loves you, priest?
Or you, archer?
What are you worth with a sword in your hand?
Or is the little girl the bravest one here?
Aye.
She might be.
But it’s me you’ll fight.
The master says they are untested.
He says you would be wise to blood them early.
There are many small cities between here and there, cities ripe for sacking.
Should you take captives, the masters will buy the healthy ones and for a good price.
And who knows?
In years, some of the boys you send them may be Unsullied in their turn.
Thus, all shall prosper.
Is it done, then?
They belong to me?
It is done.
It is done.
She holds the whip.
You hold the whip.
This bitch has her army.
Unsullied!
Forward march!
Halt!
Tell the bitch her beast won’t come.
A dragon is not a slave.
You speak Valyrian?
I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, of the blood of Old Valyria.
Valyrian is my mother tongue.
Unsullied!
Slay the masters, slay the soldiers, slay every man who holds a whip, but harm no child.
Strike the chains off every slave you see!
I am your master!
Kill her!
Kill her!
Kill her!
Dracarys.
Unsullied!
You have been slaves all your life.
Today you are free.
Any man who wishes to leave may leave, and no one will harm him.
I give you my word.
Will you fight for me?
As free men?To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
Lord, cast your light upon us.
Lord of Light, defend us.
Show us the truth.
Strike this man down if he is guilty.
Give strength to his sword if he is true.
Lord of Light, give us wisdom, for the night is dark and full of terrors.
For the night is dark and full of terrors.
Get back.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Kill him!
Lord, cast your light upon this man, your servant.
Bring him back from death and darkness.
Restore his flame.
For the night is dark and full of terrors.
Lord, cast…
Arya, don’t!
Bring him back from death and darkness…
No!
Let go of me!
Let me go!
Looks like their god likes me more than your butcher’s boy.
Burn in hell!
He will.
But not today.
Orell says there are crows patrolling on the Wall.
Tell me what you know.
There are four to a patrol, two builders to check for structural damage, two rangers to watch for enemies.
How often do these patrols go out?
It varies.
If I knew where on the Wall we were heading, I could tell you.
You’d like to know that.
There are castles guarding the Wall.
How many are manned?
Three.
You sure of that?
Which three?
Castle Black.
Aye, Castle Black.
Everyone knows Castle Black.
Which others?
EastwatchbytheSea and the Shadow Tower.
How many men remain in Castle Black?
A thousand.
Liar.
What happens to your eagle after I kill you?
Does he drift away like a kite with his strings cut, or does he just flop dead to the ground?
He’s no crow.
Just ’cause you want him inside, you don’t make him one of us.
I’m not afraid of you.
I like you, boy.
But if you lie to me, I’ll pull your guts out through your throat.
A thousand men.
We’ll find out soon enough.
I don’t need you to protect me.
Of course you do.
Who stopped Rattleshirt when he was about to cut your throat?
Who vouched for you with Mance?
It seems you owe me a debt.
Give it back.
Well, I stole it.
It’s mine.
If you want it, come steal it back.
Ygritte!
Ygritte!
Ygritte!
Seven hells.
Ygritte!
Is Orell right?
Are you still a crow?
It’s time you proved yourself.
Ygritte.
You swore some vows.
I want you to break ’em.
I want you to see me.
All of me.
We shouldn’t.
We should.
Why are you still dressed?
You know nothing, Jon Snow.
That thing you did with your mouth…
Is that what lords do to their ladies in the South?
I don’t know.
I just wanted to kiss you there is all.
Hmm.
You seemed to like it.
Aye, I liked it some.
Who taught you that?
There’s been no one else.
Only you.
A maid.
You were a maid.
I was a man of the Night’s Watch.
How about you?
Were you a maid?
What do you think?
Who was he?
Just a boy.
He came trading with his brothers.
He had red hair like me.
Kissed by fire.
But…
He was weak.
Not like you.
That was the first one.
Then there was this Thenn boy.
Spoke no Common, but, Gods, he was built like a mammoth…
Yeah, thanks.
I think I’ve heard enough.
We’d best get back.
Tormund…
I’m not done with you yet.
How long’s it been since you had a bath?
Let’s not go back.
Let’s stay here a while longer.
I don’t ever want to leave this cave, Jon Snow.
Not ever.
I want my gold.
It says clearly on that note, you’ll be paid when the war is over.
Piss on that!
You’re nothing but thieves.
We’re outlaws.
Outlaws steal.
You’re lucky we didn’t kill you.
Come try it, archer.
I’ll shove those arrows up your ass.
You can’t let him go.
He’s a murderer.
He’s guilty.
Not in the eyes of God.
You can’t!
Enough!
The judgement isn’t ours to make.
Go in peace, Sandor Clegane.
The Lord of Light isn’t done with you yet.
Riders coming through!
The Kingslayer.
Down!
On your knees.
Lord Bolton, I give you the Kingslayer.
Pick him up, Locke.
You’ve lost a hand.
No, my lord, he has it here.
Take this away.
Send it to his father?
You’ll hold your tongue unless you want to lose it.
Cut her free.
Apologies, my lady.
You’re under my protection now.
Thank you, my lord.
Find suitable rooms for our guests.
We’ll speak later.
Lord Bolton.
Is there word from the capital?
You haven’t heard?
Stannis Baratheon laid siege to King’s Landing.
Sailed into Blackwater Bay.
Stormed the gates with thousands of men.
And your sister…
How can I put this?
Your sister…
Is alive and well.
Your father’s forces prevailed.
Ser Jaime isn’t well.
Take him to Qyburn.
Will I die?
No.
The corruption has spread.
I fear it must be cut away.
The safest course would be to take the whole arm off.
Then you’ll die.
You’re no maester.
Where’s your chain?
The Citadel stripped me of it.
They found some of my experiments too bold.
I can leave your upper arm, make the cut at your elbow.
I don’t need my right hand to kill you.
I can take away the rotting flesh and try and burn out the corruption with boiling wine.
Mmm.
With any luck, that will suffice.
You’ll need milk of the poppy.
No milk of the poppy.
There will be pain.
I’ll scream.
Quite a bit of pain.
I’ll scream loudly.
Lord Baelish.
Your Grace.
I wonder if I might ask you for a favour.
Of course, Your Grace.
I believe that House Tyrell don’t hold the crown’s best interests at heart.
I see.
And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?
My father’s a practical man.
He appreciates facts.
Myself, I often find them a hindrance.
And he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know.
He’s almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who don’t.
You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells.
I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital.
I shall do my best.
Thank you.
And your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?
I assure you that it will.
Gods, boy, that’s enough.
We’re not in a tavern.
Pardon, my lady.
No need to speak.
Are there any figs?
Fetch some.
I always take figs midafternoon.
They help move the bowels.
To what do I owe this summons?
Thank you for seeing me, my lady.
I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters.
I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters?
It’s the royal wedding.
I’m told you had a hand in planning it.
Naturally.
It’s shaping up to be a very involved affair.
The word “extravagant” has been used.
What good is the word “extravagant” if it can’t be used to describe a royal wedding?
I understand that.
Good.
But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown.
As of now, it’s a huge expense.
And?
And we’re at war, Lady Olenna.
Oh, I’d nearly forgotten.
And maintaining supply lines…
I can’t think how it slipped my mind.
What is it, , infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied?
, mounted lances.
, in support.
Provisions, so this city might survive the winter.
A million bushels of wheat.
Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye.
, head of cattle.
, sheep.
You don’t have to lecture me about wartime expenses.
I’m quite familiar with them.
And we are grateful for your contributions, which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.
As is a royal wedding.
The people are hungry for more than just food.
They crave distractions.
And if we don’t provide them, they’ll create their own.
And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces.
A royal wedding is much safer.
Wouldn’t you say?
I would.
And traditionally paid for by the royal family.
I was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched.
Imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper.
Where did you go for them, Volantis?
My lady…
Oh, very well.
I won’t have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part.
We’ll pay for half, and the celebrations will go on as planned.
Is that sufficient?
Quite.
Thank you.
Very good, then.
That’s settled.
Good day.
Give me that.
What are you doing?
Just mending Lord Beric’s armour.
Why?
I’m going to stay and smith for the Brotherhood.
Have you lost your mind?
When the Lannisters find this place, you think they’ll spare the smiths?
They’ll cave your head in.
They wanted to kill me long before I joined the Brotherhood.
You don’t have to.
I want to.
They need good men.
Robb needs good men, too.
We’re leaving tomorrow.
And then you…
What?
Serve him?
I’ve served men my entire life.
I served Master Mott at King’s Landing, and he sold me to the Watch.
I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal, wondering every day if I’d get tortured or killed.
I’m done serving.
You just said you were serving Lord Beric.
He may be their leader, but they chose him.
These men are brothers.
They’re a family.
I’ve never had a family.
I can be your family.
You wouldn’t be my family.
You’d be “my lady.
” Willem.
Willem!
Is this a rescue?
Lannister filth!
Take him!
Please, I didn’t do anything.
I’m just a squire.
Please…
Bring them in.
Is that all of them?
It took five of you to murder two unarmed squires?
Not murder, Your Grace.
Vengeance.
Vengeance?
Those boys didn’t kill your sons.
I saw Harrion die on the battlefield, and Torrhen…
Was strangled by the Kingslayer.
They were his kin.
They were boys!
Look at them.
Tell your mother to look at them.
She killed them as much as I.
My mother had nothing to do with this.
This was your treason.
It’s treason to free your enemies.
In war, you kill your enemies.
Did your father not teach you that, boy?
Leave him.
Aye.
Leave me to the King.
He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free.
That’s how he deals with treason.
Our King in the North.
Or should I call him the King Who Lost the North?
Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon.
Hang the rest.
Mercy!
I didn’t kill anyone.
I only watched for the guards.
This one was only the watcher.
Hang him last, so he can watch the others die.
Please!
Please, no.
They made me do it!
They made me!
They made me!
Word of this can’t leave Riverrun.
They were Tywin Lannister’s nephews.
The Lannisters pay their debts.
They never stop talking about it.
Would you make me a liar as well?
It wouldn’t be lying.
We will bury them and remain silent until the war is done.
I’m not fighting for justice if I don’t serve justice to murderers in my ranks, no matter how highborn.
He has to die.
The Karstarks are Northmen.
They won’t forgive the killing of their lord.
Your mother’s right.
If you do this, the Karstarks will abandon you.
You tended to their wounds.
You brought them supper.
Now they’re dead.
And more boys will keep dying until this war is over.
You need Karstark men to end it.
Spare his life.
Keep him as a hostage.
A hostage.
Tell the Karstarks that as long as they’re loyal, he will not be harmed.
The blood of the First Men flows through my veins as much as yours, boy.
I fought the Mad King for your father.
I fought Joffrey for you.
We are kin, Stark and Karstark.
That didn’t stop you from betraying me, and it won’t save you now.
I don’t want it to save me.
I want it to haunt you to the end of your days.
Kneel, my lord.
Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold, here, in sight of gods and men, I sentence you to die.
Would you speak a final word?
Kill me and be cursed.
You are no king of mine.
Joffrey.
Cersei.
Ilyn Payne.
Ser Meryn.
The Hound.
What are you going to do with me?
At first light we’ll ride for Riverrun.
Your brother’s there now.
He’ll make a contribution to our cause, and you can go home.
I’m a hostage and you’re selling me.
Don’t think of it that way.
But it is that way.
It is.
And it isn’t.
More is than isn’t.
Beric admired your father a great deal, you know.
He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether.
So, why don’t you?
We need the gold.
Do I frighten you, child?
No.
You’re angry with me, and I don’t blame you, but letting him go was the right thing.
I have more reason to want him hanged.
I thought he killed you.
He did.
But how…
Thoros, how many times have you brought me back?
It’s the Lord of Light who brings you back.
I’m just the lucky drunk who says the words.
How many times?
Five, I think.
No, this makes six.
Six.
There was the first time.
The Mountain.
Show her.
Lance right through the chest.
Then I was stabbed in the belly.
Then it was an arrow in the back.
And that axe in the side.
Then the Lannisters caught me and executed me for treason.
Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?
Both.
Fuckers couldn’t decide.
And the Hound makes six.
Second time I’ve been killed by a Clegane.
You’d think you’d learn.
It’s not getting any easier, you know.
I know.
Every time I come back, I’m a bit less.
Pieces of you get chipped away.
Could you bring back a man without a head?
Not six times.
Just once.
I don’t think it works that way, child.
He was a good man, Ned Stark.
He’s at rest now, somewhere.
I would never wish my life upon him.
I would.
You’re alive.
Lord, cast your light upon me.
Protect me in the darkness.
Burn away my sins.
Help me serve you.
Use me as you will.
For the night is dark and full of terrors.
I have prayed day and night for you to come to me.
My lady.
I meant to come sooner.
The battle…
I know of your troubles, my King.
The Lady Melisandre has told me everything.
Yes, of course.
You mustn’t despair.
Your claim is true.
You will be victorious.
I believed that once.
You are the One God’s champion and the finest man I’ve ever known.
Selyse.
I’ve broken a sacred vow.
I’ve sinned.
No.
I’ve wronged you.
I have shamed you.
You’re doing God’s work.
You don’t understand.
The Red Woman…
The Lady Melisandre…
I know, Stannis.
The Lady Melisandre has told me everything.
No act done in service of the Lord of Light can ever be a sin.
When she told me, I wept with joy.
Oh, my sweet boys.
Petyr, Tommard, Edric.
I thank God every day for bringing Melisandre to us.
She gave you a son.
I gave you nothing.
That’s not true.
So, you’ve come to see her as well?
There is no need.
You must keep away from such distractions.
She’s my daughter.
I want to see her.
You are a king.
You don’t need my permission.
The sea I know, I know Oh, oh, oh The birds have scales And the fish take wing I know, I know Oh, oh, oh Shireen.
Father!
You’ve grown since I last saw you.
Mother said you fought in a battle.
Did you win?
No.
Did the Onion Knight come back with you?
He did.
He fought bravely.
He hasn’t come to visit me.
He said he’d bring me back a present from the capital.
He won’t be visiting, child.
Why not?
He’s my friend.
Look.
He made this for me.
But don’t tell Mother I have it.
It’s a secret.
Mother doesn’t like the Onion Knight.
Ser Davos is a traitor.
He’s rotting in a dungeon cell for his crime.
Best forget him.
Not so hard.
You’ll scrub the skin off.
What are you doing here?
I need a bath.
Help me out of these rags.
Now get out.
There’s another tub.
This one suits me fine.
Don’t worry.
I’m not interested.
If I faint, pull me out.
I don’t intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub.
Why should I care how you die?
You swore a solemn vow, remember?
You’re supposed to get me to King’s Landing in one piece.
Not going so well, is it?
No wonder Renly died, with you guarding him.
That was unworthy.
Forgive me.
You protected me better than most…
Don’t you mock me.
I’m apologising.
I’m sick of fighting.
Let’s call a truce.
You need trust to have a truce.
I trust you.
There it is.
There’s the look.
I’ve seen it for years, on face after face.
You all despise me.
Kingslayer.
Oathbreaker.
A man without honour.
You’ve heard of wildfire?
Of course.
The Mad King was obsessed with it.
He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones.
He burned lords he didn’t like.
He burned Hands who disobeyed him.
He burned anyone who was against him.
Before long, half the country was against him.
Aerys saw traitors everywhere, so he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city, beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom.
Under houses, stables, taverns.
Even beneath the Red Keep itself.
Finally, the day of reckoning came.
Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident.
But my father arrived first, with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels.
I knew my father better than that.
He’s never been one to pick the losing side.
I told the Mad King as much.
I urged him to surrender peacefully.
But the King didn’t listen to me.
He didn’t listen to Varys, who tried to warn him.
But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt.
“You can trust the Lannisters,” he said.
“The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.
” So, we opened the gates, and my father sacked the city.
Once again, I came to the King, begging him to surrender.
He told me to bring him my father’s head.
Then he turned to his pyromancer.
“Burn them all,” he said.
“Burn them in their homes.
Burn them in their beds.
” Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it?
Would you have kept your oath then?
First, I killed the pyromancer.
And then, when the King turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back.
“Burn them all,” he kept saying.
“Burn them all.
” I don’t think he expected to die.
He meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash.
I slit his throat to make sure that didn’t happen.
That’s where Ned Stark found me.
If this is true…
Why didn’t you tell anyone?
Why didn’t you tell Lord Stark?
Stark?
You think the honourable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side?
He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me.
By what right does the wolf judge the lion?
By what right?
Help!
Help!
The Kingslayer!
Jaime.
My name is Jaime.
Onion Knight.
Ser Onion Knight.
Princess?
Gods, what are you doing here?
Shh!
You’ll wake Bert.
Bert?
He’s the fat one.
He’s on guard duty tonight.
He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot.
Go back to your room.
You’re not supposed to be here.
If your father knew…
He said you were a traitor.
Are you?
I am, child.
I disobeyed my king, your father, and now I’m paying the price.
I don’t care.
You’re my friend.
You must get bored down here.
I brought you something to read.
It’s about Aegon and his dragons.
Aegon used to live here.
Did you know that?
And the Targaryens built this castle.
Aye.
So they did.
You can hide the book under your cloak.
It’s a good one.
I’ll bring you more.
Thank you, my lady.
I’m sure it’s a fine book, but it’s wasted on me.
Take it.
I have more.
My lady, I can’t read the words.
You can’t?
I’ll teach you.
I’ll come when Bert’s on duty and teach you.
No.
No.
No.
It’s easy.
It’ll be fun.
Go.
We can’t.
Why not?
What will they do, lock us in cells?
I wouldn’t know where to start.
At the beginning.
This word is “Aegon.
” When you see “A,” “E,” and “G” together like that, it sounds like “egg.
” And the title of the whole book is An History of Aegon the Conqueror and His Conquest of Westeros.
It was a bitch of a siege.
Mmm.
You were first through the breach at Pyke?
The second.
Thoros of Myr went in alone, waving that flaming sword of his.
Thoros of Myr.
Bloody madman.
Robert knighted you after the battle?
Proudest moment of my life.
One knee in the dust, the King’s sword on my shoulder, listening to the words, “In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.
” All I could think of was how badly I had to piss.
In full plate metal for hours.
Never occurred to me till the fighting was over.
I was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the King’s boots.
Robert would have laughed.
He was a good man, a great warrior.
And a terrible king.
I burned away my years fighting for terrible kings.
You swore an oath.
Yes.
And a man of honour keeps his vows, even if he’s serving a drunk or a lunatic.
Just once in my life before it’s over, I want to know what it’s like to serve with pride, to fight for someone I believe in.
Do you believe in her?
With all my heart.
These are the ones?
Yes, Khaleesi.
The officers.
You did not choose this life.
But you are free men now.
And free men make their own choices.
Have you selected your own leader from amongst your ranks?
Remove your helmet.
This one has the honour.
What is your name?
Grey Worm.
Grey Worm.
All Unsullied boys are given new names when they are cut.
Grey Worm, Red Flea, Black Rat.
Names that remind them what they are…
Vermin.
From this day forward, you will choose your own names.
You will tell your fellow soldiers to do the same.
Throw away your slave name.
Choose the name your parents gave you, or any other.
A name that gives you pride.
“Grey Worm” gives me pride.
It is a lucky name.
The name this one was born with was cursed.
That was the name he had when he was taken as a slave.
But Grey Worm is the name this one had the day Daenerys Stormborn set him free.
King Robert wanted her dead.
Of course he wanted her dead.
She’s a Targaryen.
The last Targaryen.
I suppose no one on the Small Council could speak sense to him.
I didn’t sit on the Small Council.
No?
Doesn’t the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard traditionally…
Traditionally, yes, but I killed a dozen of Robert’s friends during his rebellion.
He didn’t want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the Mad King.
Can’t say I minded much.
I always hated the politics.
Yeah, I imagine I would, too.
Hours spent jabbering about backstabbings and betrayals the world over.
Mmmhmm.
Still, she’ll have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms.
She’ll have good men around her to advise her, men with experience.
Which men do you have in mind?
Forgive me for what I’m about to say, but your reputation in Westeros has suffered over the years.
It suffered for a reason.
I sold men into slavery.
I don’t know if your presence by her side will help our cause when we go home.
Our cause?
Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy defending the Khaleesi against King Robert’s assassins while you were still bowing to the man.
We both want her to rule.
Am I wrong?
You only joined us a few days ago.
I can’t speak to your intentions.
If we’re truly her loyal servants, we will do whatever needs to be done, no matter the cost, no matter our pride.
You’re not Lord Commander here.
You’re just another exile.
And I take my orders from the Queen.
Come to bed.
You were right.
The Karstarks are gone.
Almost half our forces.
Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel.
Nothing.
Only wait.
Don’t let him.
What can I do?
Attack King’s Landing?
There’s nothing he’d like better.
He’d crush us in a day.
We could ride north.
Take your land back from the Greyjoys.
Wait out the winter.
Winter could last five years.
Once my bannermen are home again, sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families, warm and safe, they’ll never ride south again.
When I gathered my lords together, we had a purpose, a mission.
Now we’re like a band of bickering children.
Give them a new purpose.
What?
I don’t know.
I don’t even know where Winterfell is.
Here.
And we’re here.
King’s Landing…
What is it?
I can’t force them to meet us in the field and I can’t attack them where they’re strongest, but I can attack them where they’re not.
And Casterly Rock can’t run away.
I’m going to take their home away from them.
Can you do it?
I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home.
There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army who hasn’t already sided with the Lannisters.
The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry.
Walder Frey.
He’s such a splendid fighter.
Do you have any idea when we might…
I’ll plant the seed as soon as Joffrey and I are married.
It should grow quickly.
Joffrey won’t let me leave.
He’s got too many reasons to keep me here.
And only one to let you go.
Because it will please me.
Squire.
Well fought, ser.
That was no fight.
I don’t know you.
Olyver, if it please you.
I should like to see you spar with a proper partner, ser.
How did you know?
Know what?
That I wanted to.
My lord…
I’ll have you know I’m to be married soon, and even my intended hasn’t the slightest notion.
They rarely do, in my experience.
You have a good deal of experience, do you?
With the husbands.
That didn’t take long.
Well, it took long enough.
It seems our Knight of Flowers is engaged to be wed.
Is he?
And…
Who’s the lucky girl?
She may not be the grandest ship in the world or the fastest, but she’s mine.
I’ve always wanted a ship.
Now I want a dozen.
Strange, isn’t it?
What is?
It doesn’t matter what we want, once we get it, then we want something else.
Your hair is different.
Is it?
Lady Margaery wears it that way.
Many ladies wear it this way.
I have good news.
I’ll be leaving the city soon.
You still want me to come with you?
It’s not a question of what I want.
It’s what you want.
You want to go home, don’t you?
Of course.
More than anything.
But maybe it would be better to wait.
I’ve been thinking how dangerous it would be.
Not just for me, but for you.
You’ve been so kind.
I’d feel terrible if anything happened to you.
I can’t tell you how touched I am by your concern for my welfare.
I hope you know that I’m your friend, Sansa.
Your true friend.
I do, Lord Baelish.
Petyr.
Petyr.
If you wish to stay, then of course you will stay.
We’ll speak again when I return.
You’re late.
What’s she doing here?
Our business concerns her, too.
Sit.
You’ll be pleased to learn that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell, I’ve saved the crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding.
Never mind that now.
We have something important to discuss.
I’m Master of Coin.
Saving money is important.
Stop that.
You’re making me uncomfortable.
Your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.
Very well.
She’s a lovely girl.
Missing some of Loras’ favourite bits, but I’m sure they’ll make do.
Your jokes are not appreciated.
It wasn’t my best, but…
I bring them into the royal fold, and this is how they repay me, by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me.
Sansa is the key to the North?
I seem to remember she has an older brother.
The Karstarks have marched home.
The Young Wolf has lost half his army.
His days are numbered.
Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers.
That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell, and I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells.
The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war.
Do you really think it’s wise to refuse them?
There’s nothing to refuse.
This is a plot.
Plots are not public knowledge.
And the Tyrells won’t carry this one out until after Joffrey’s wedding.
We need to act first and kill this union in its crib.
And how do we do that?
We find Sansa Stark a different husband.
Wonderful.
Yes, it is.
You can’t mean it.
I can and I do.
Joffrey’s made this poor girl’s life miserable since the day he took her father’s head.
Now she’s finally free of him, and you give her to me?
That’s cruel, even for you.
Do you intend on mistreating her?
The girl’s happiness is not my concern, nor yours.
She’s a child!
She’s flowered, I assure you.
She and I have discussed it at length.
There, you see?
You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her.
Surely you’re capable of that.
And if I refuse?
You wanted to be rewarded for your valour in battle.
Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for.
And it is past time you were wed.
I was wed.
Or don’t you remember?
Only too well.
You should be thanking the Gods for this.
This is more than you deserve.
Tyrion will do as he’s bid.
As will you.
What do you mean?
You’ll marry Ser Loras.
I will not.
The boy is heir to Highgarden.
Tyrion will secure the North, you will secure the Reach.
No, I won’t do it.
Yes, you will.
You’re still fertile.
You need to marry again and breed.
I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare.
You’re my daughter!
You will do as I command, and you will marry Loras Tyrell and put an end to the disgusting rumours about you once and for all.
Father, don’t make me do it again, please.
Not another word.
My children.
You’ve disgraced the Lannister name for far too long.To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
You’ve got too much wood in there.
But the more wood, the bigger the fire.
It needs to breathe.
Take off that big log.
Ah.
You know your fires.
Someone built your fires for you growing up?
It doesn’t get so cold down in the Reach.
And there were servants, of course.
I knew you were highborn.
Oh, I found something at the Fist of the First Men.
Buried treasure.
Thousands of years old.
I think.
What does it do?
I’m not sure that it does anything.
It’s beautiful, though, isn’t it?
How much longer?
Not so far.
A few more days.
Is the Wall as big as they say?
Bigger.
So big you can’t even see the top sometimes.
It’s hidden in clouds.
You’re playing with me.
I’m not.
It’s feet high, all made of ice.
On a warm day you can see it weeping.
Castle Black is nice enough.
They keep a fire burning in the long hall day and night.
And Hobb makes venison stew with onions.
Very tasty.
Sometimes, one of the brothers will sing.
Dareon sings best.
Do you sing?
No.
No, no, no.
Not very well.
Sing me a song.
Oh, all right.
Let’s see.
Oh.
The Father’s face is stern and strong He sits and judges right from wrong He weighs our lives, the short and long And loves the little children The Mother gives the gift of life And watches over every wife Her gentle smile ends all strife And she loves her little children That’s not how you skin a rabbit.
I know how to skin a rabbit.
Not by the looks of it.
You grow up north of the Wall, you learn the proper way to handle game.
I didn’t see any game before I got here.
If I had a bow, I could have shot a dozen.
Well, I made this bow myself.
Guess you don’t learn how to do that north of the Wall.
You learn how to use your fists.
Oh, you’re gonna punch the rabbits to death?
I had someone else in mind.
Well, someone else is sitting right here.
You’re both very good at skinning rabbits.
Some of us are just a little better.
Well, some of us would say thank you when someone else hunts down their breakfast for them.
Or don’t they teach you to say thank you north of the Wall?
You’ve got a big mouth, girl, and too many teeth.
Stop it!
Hmm.
Hodor.
You’ve been fighting since you met.
Just stop it.
Lady Reed here’s got a stick so far up her ass, it’s a wonder her feet touch the ground.
You’ve been nasty to her every day.
Of course she’s nasty back.
Me?
It’s my fault?
First time I met her, she put a knife to my throat.
First time I met you, you held a knife at me.
We can’t fight each other.
We’ll never make it to the Wall.
I want you both to make peace.
Your way of skinning rabbits is quicker.
I said so, didn’t I?
Osha!
You’re a good little hunter.
Thank you.
See?
Not so hard, is it?
Thank you.
Don’t push me.
I’m right here with you.
What’s happening?
I’m right here with you.
What’s wrong with him?
The visions take their toll.
He’s having one now?
I saw Jon Snow.
You saw him?
At Castle Black?
He was on the wrong side of the Wall, surrounded by enemies.
Used to be you couldn’t find a tree within a mile of the Wall.
Crows would come out every morning with axes.
Your flock gets smaller every year.
You ever climbed it before?
No.
But Tormund’s done it half a hundred times.
You’re afraid.
Aren’t you?
Aye.
Well, it’s a long way up and a long way down.
But I’ve waited my whole life to see the world from up there.
Here, sit down.
I brought a pair for you.
They’re too big for you, but they’re good.
You kill someone for them?
Nah.
I didn’t kill him, but I bet his balls are still bruised.
He wasn’t good to me the way you’re good to me.
Well, he didn’t do that thing you do with your tongue.
Can we not talk about that here?
“Can we not talk about that here?
“I’m Jon Snow.
“I’ve killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand, “but I’m scared of naked girls.
” Did I seem scared the other day?
You were trembling like a leaf.
Only in the beginning.
Huh.
Only in the beginning.
You’re a proper lover, Jon Snow.
And don’t worry.
Your secret’s safe with me.
What secret?
Do you think I’m as dumb as all those girls in silk dresses you knew growing up?
You’re loyal and you’re brave.
You didn’t stop being a crow the day you walked into Mance Rayder’s tent.
But I’m your woman now, Jon Snow.
You’re going to be loyal to your woman.
The Night’s Watch don’t care if you live or die.
Mance Rayder don’t care if I live or die.
We’re just soldiers and there’s more to carry on if we go down.
It’s you and me that matters to me and you.
Don’t ever betray me.
I won’t.
‘Cause I’ll cut your pretty cock right off and wear it ’round me neck.
Sink your metal deep and make sure it holds before taking your next step.
And if you fall, don’t scream.
You don’t want that to be the last thing she remembers.
Joffrey.
Cersei.
Ilyn Payne.
You’re good.
You’re not as good as you think you are.
Face, tits, balls…
I hit ’em right where I wanted to.
Aye, but you took your sweet time of it.
You won’t be fighting straw men, little lady.
Show me your position.
Keep your elbow high.
You want your back doing the hard labour.
You’re holding.
Never hold.
What?
Your muscles tense up when you hold.
Pull the string back to the centre of your chin and release.
Never hold.
But I have to aim.
Never aim.
Never aim?
Your eye knows where it wants the arrow to go.
Trust your eye.
There’s someone out there.
That’s about far enough.
We come as friends.
Begging your pardon, m’lady, but we’ll be the judge of that.
Valar Morghulis.
Valar Dohaeris.
I don’t see many priestesses of R’hllor in the Riverlands.
You are Thoros of Myr.
The High Priest gave you a mission.
Turn King Robert away from his idols and towards the Lord of Light.
What happened?
I failed.
You quit, you mean.
The heathen continue to slaughter each other and you continue to get drunk.
You worship Him your way, and I’ll worship Him mine.
Do you speak the Common tongue?
My friends here don’t speak High Valyrian.
Why are you here, my lady?
Forgive my manners.
I don’t see many ladies these days.
Lucky for the ladies.
How many times has the Lord brought him back?
Six.
That’s not possible.
The Lord has smiled upon me.
You should not have this power.
I have no power.
I ask the Lord for His favour, and He responds as He will.
I’ve always been a terrible priest.
Drank too much rum.
Fucked all the whores in King’s Landing.
It’s a terrible thing to say, but by the time I came to Westeros, I didn’t believe in our Lord.
I decided that He, that all the Gods, were stories we told the children to make them behave.
So I wore the robes, and every now and then I’d recite the prayers, but it was just for show.
A spectacle for the locals.
Until the Mountain drove a lance through this one’s heart.
I knelt beside his cold body and said the old words.
Not because I believed in them, but…
He was my friend and he was dead.
And they were the only words I knew.
And for the first time in my life, the Lord replied.
Beric’s eyes opened, and I knew the truth.
Our god is the one true god.
And all men must serve Him.
You’ve been to the other side.
The other side?
There is no other side.
I have been to the darkness, my lady.
He sent you to us for a reason.
You have someone He needs.
Bodkin point.
Penetrates plate at yards.
Can you make ’em?
Yeah, nothing tricky about it.
Just need decent steel.
I’ll get you the steel.
Come on.
I don’t like that woman.
That’s ’cause you’re a girl.
What does that have to do with anything?
Forgive me, lad.
What are you doing?
Let go of him.
Tell them to stop.
Come on.
He wants to be one of you.
He wants to join the Brotherhood.
Stop them!
We serve the Lord of Light, and the Lord of Light needs this boy.
Did the Lord of Light tell you that, or did she?
You’re not doing this for your god.
You’re doing it for gold.
We’re doing it for both, girl.
We can’t defend the people without weapons and horses and food.
And we can’t get weapons and horses and food without gold.
You told me this was a Brotherhood.
You told me I could be one of you.
You are more than they can ever be.
They’re just foot soldiers in the great war.
You will make kings rise and fall.
You’re a witch.
You’re going to hurt him.
I see a darkness in you.
And in that darkness, eyes staring back at me…
Brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes.
Eyes you’ll shut forever.
We will meet again.
You staring at me ass, Jon Snow?
Look out!
You all right?
Just seeing if you can take a hit, lad.
Sorry.
Were you sleeping?
Wa…
Wa…
Wa…
Water?
You want some water.
I wish I had some for you.
So, let’s play a game.
Which body part do you need the least?
Please.
“Please” is not a body part.
I’ll tell you everything, please.
But you’ve already told me everything.
Remember?
Your daddy was mean to you.
The Starks didn’t appreciate you.
One good bit, though.
The Stark boys, they’re still alive.
Wouldn’t that be a hunt to remember?
You failed, but I’m a better hunter than you.
Now…
How about your little finger?
You don’t use that for much, do you?
No?
Good.
Let’s start with that.
Ah!
You’ve been wondering why you’re here, haven’t you?
Where you are.
Who I am.
Why I’m doing this to you.
So, guess.
If you guess right, I’ll tell you.
By the Old Gods and the New, I swear it.
You win the game if you can figure out who I am and why I’m torturing you, and I win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger.
If I win, you’ll let me go?
If you think this has a happy ending, you haven’t been paying attention.
Please.
You say “please” again and you’ll wish you hadn’t.
You first.
Where are we?
The North.
Too vague.
Deepwood Motte.
Terrible guess.
Now, where?
Last Hearth.
Do I look like a fucking Umber to you?
Karhold!
Karhold?
How did you know that?
Did you see any banners flying when we came in?
No.
It was just a guess.
Very good, Lord Theon.
And who am I?
Torrhen Karstark.
He’s dead.
Strangled by the Kingslayer.
He was your brother.
Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark.
You swore to tell me if I…
You’re right.
Lord Rickard Karstark is Robb Stark’s bannerman.
I betrayed Robb.
That’s why you’re torturing me.
Yes.
You win.
Of course, you forgot to ask one question.
You forgot to ask if I’m a liar.
I’m afraid I am.
Everything I told you is a lie.
This isn’t happening to you for a reason.
But, well, one reason…
I enjoy it.
Please, cut it off!
Cut it off!
Cut it off!
I win.
Thank you for riding here so quickly.
I know travel isn’t easy in these times.
The roads are crawling with cutthroats and bandits.
When the King of the North summons us, we come.
Our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the North can continue if his terms are met.
Lord Frey requires a formal apology for your violation of your sacred oath to marry one of his daughters.
Of course.
He deserves as much.
I was in the wrong.
As restitution for this betrayal, he demands Harrenhal and all its attendant lands.
I don’t think that’s…
We are fighting for the North.
Harrenhal is not in the North.
It is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it.
And there’s something else.
We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.
Not what, whom.
What?
Uh, no.
Our father requires Lord Edmure to wed one of his daughters.
Roslin.
How old is she?
Nineteen.
Could I see her first?
You want to count her teeth?
We depart for the Twins in the morning.
We need an answer before we leave, and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end.
Your father does realise we’re in the middle of a war?
Father is old.
It will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband.
And his recent experience has made him wary of long engagements.
He has every right to be.
Please excuse us while we discuss it.
Why should I let that old ferret choose my bride for me?
At the very least, I should be offered the same choice you were.
I’m his liege lord.
He’s a proud man and we’ve wounded him.
I didn’t wound him.
My answer is no.
Listen to me and listen very carefully.
You…
The laws of gods and men are very clear.
No man can compel another man to marry.
The laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth.
It’s all right.
You heard him.
If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead.
He’s wanted me for one of his daughters since I was .
He’s not gonna stop wanting it now.
When I say no, he will come back and offer me a daughter of my choosing.
You’re willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife?
I have a war to fight.
We can’t win it without them.
I have no time to haggle.
You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill.
You recall that heroic engagement?
I had something less permanent in mind.
I’ve won every battle, but I’m losing this war.
If we don’t do this and do it now, we’re lost.
I’ll marry her.
You’re paying for my sins, Uncle.
It’s not fair or right.
I’ll remember it.
I see my men have finally found you something appropriate to wear.
Yes.
Most kind of them.
You’re a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton.
I am acting on Lady Stark’s orders to return Jaime Lannister to King’s Landing.
When King Robb left Harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner.
If she wasn’t his mother, he’d have hanged her for treason.
I should send you back to Robb Stark.
You should.
But instead, you’re sitting here, watching me fail at dinner.
Why might that be?
Wars cost money.
Many people would pay a great deal for you.
We both know who would pay the most.
Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution.
You’re right.
Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies.
It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it.
King Robb is keeping your father quite busy.
He doesn’t have time for anything else.
He’ll make time for you.
As soon as you’re well enough to travel, I will allow you to go to King’s Landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made.
And you will swear to tell your father the truth, that I had nothing to do with your maiming.
Shall we drink on it?
I don’t partake.
You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?
Very well.
My lady, may our journey continue without further incident.
Oh, she won’t be going with you.
I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to…
You are charged with abetting treason.
I’m afraid I must insist.
You’re in no place to insist on anything.
I would have hoped you’d learned your lesson about overplaying your position.
Impossible.
Why?
My grandson is the pride of Highgarden.
The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms.
Your daughter…
Is rich, the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms, and the mother of the King.
Old.
Old?
Old.
I’m something of an expert on the subject.
Her change will be upon her before long.
I’ll spare you the details of what will happen then.
You may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely.
The years punish us as well, I promise you that.
My stomach remains quite strong, however.
The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson’s nocturnal activities.
Do you deny them?
Oh, not at all.
A swordswallower through and through.
A boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the Kingdoms and remove the stain from his name.
Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin?
Sons of your father’s bannermen, squires, stable boys?
Of course.
And you never…
No.
Not once?
Not in any way?
Never.
I congratulate you upon your restraint.
But it’s natural, boys having a go beneath the sheets.
Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behaviour.
I wouldn’t say that.
True, we don’t tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but brothers and sisters…
Where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out.
I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it.
Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing.
Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells, thanks to our new affiliation.
I don’t care what people believe.
And neither do you.
As an authority on myself, I must disagree.
Now, if the rumours about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all, and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt.
And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, we’re throwing another prized flower into the dirt.
It is a chance we simply cannot take.
The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable?
All right.
I’ll remove it for you.
If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei, I will name him to the Kingsguard.
I’m sure you’re familiar with the Kingsguard vows.
He will never marry.
He will never have children.
Ah.
The Tyrell name will fade.
And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.
You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?
I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously.
So, shall I draw up the order?
Or do you consent to this match?
It’s a rare enough thing, a man who lives up to his reputation.
No!
We’ve gotta cut them loose!
No!
Take my hand!
That’s a wonderful pin.
It’s more of a brooch, really.
Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin, so…
I’m very happy about…
Yes.
I am as well.
I feel like I’m in a dream.
Yes, me, too.
Definitely.
I’ve dreamed of a large wedding since I was young.
The guests, the food, the tournaments.
And the bride, of course.
The most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves.
Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?
No.
I had never left Winterfell before I came to King’s Landing.
But it sounds wonderful.
I can’t wait to see it.
And to leave this place.
It’s terrible, isn’t it?
The most terrible place there is.
I don’t suppose there’s anything we can do about this.
We can have them both killed.
It’s hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement.
Probably Sansa.
Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.
Father doesn’t discriminate.
We’re all being shipped off to hell together.
On a boat you built.
The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family.
I did what I did to protect our family.
I’m your family.
A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family’s survival.
Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.
I do admit it.
If it weren’t for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here.
Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate.
Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you.
There are two people in King’s Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard.
Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?
The impulse I understand.
He hates me because I’m the only one who tells him what he really is.
So, fair enough.
He wants me dead.
But his stupidity?
He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known.
But the King orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army.
The boy’s an idiot.
What do you want me to say?
I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.
Probably.
But not from Joffrey.
He won’t do anything now Father’s here.
Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister.
Not the Tyrells.
Soon they won’t need to be afraid of him.
Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doeeyed whore, and so will his children and their children.
History will be taken from our hands.
You may escape, at least.
Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels.
When Jaime gets back, yes.
But when will that be?
He’s out there somewhere.
Jaime or not, I’m truly fucked.
Who’s going to tell her?
Do you think people will like it?
I don’t think they will even notice it.
You’re right.
It’s not my wedding.
Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King’s Landing.
They’d never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding.
Loras likes green and gold brocade.
I’m sure he does.
Will they let me invite my family?
They haven’t asked my opinion.
But do you think they will?
No.
Lady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you.
Should I…
I beg your pardon, my lady.
Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion.
I was trying on a gown for Joffrey’s wedding.
Yes, it should be quite a wedding.
I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa.
Of course.
Alone, if I may.
Why do you need to speak to her alone?
Shae.
Please excuse her.
She’s not from here.
But I trust her, even though she tells me not to.
Sometimes we think we want to hear something, and it’s only afterwards, when it’s too late, that we realise we wished we’d heard it under entirely different circumstances.
It’s all right, really.
How to begin?
It’s…
This…
This…
This is awkward.
A thousand blades taken from the hands of Aegon’s fallen enemies, forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread.
There aren’t , blades.
There aren’t even .
I’ve counted.
I’m sure you have.
Ugly old thing.
Yet it has a certain appeal.
The Lysa Arryn of chairs.
Shame you had to settle for your second choice.
Early days, my friend.
It is flattering, really, you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want.
Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you.
Although who doesn’t like to see their friends fail now and then?
You’re so right.
For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells.
If I’m going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there.
But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect…
You didn’t bring her any enjoyment.
And she didn’t bring me any enjoyment.
She was a bad investment on my part.
Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new.
Something daring.
And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience.
I did what I did for the good of the realm.
The realm?
Do you know what the realm is?
It’s the , blades of Aegon’s enemies.
A story we agree to tell each other over and over, till we forget that it’s a lie.
But what do we have left once we abandon the lie?
Chaos.
A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.
Chaos isn’t a pit.
Chaos is a ladder.
Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again.
The fall breaks them.
And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse.
They cling to the realm or the Gods or love.
Illusions.
Only the ladder is real.
The climb is all there is.To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
How far are we?
About a week, I think.
You think?
You don’t know?
When we went to Castle Black, we took the King’s Road.
You and your roads.
Is that how you lot do your fighting?
You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?
Most of the time, yes.
How do the men holding the banners fight?
They don’t, really.
It’s a great honour to carry your house sigil.
And the drummers…
Is that a great honour, too?
Usually it’s the young boys banging the drums.
So, what good are they?
They help the men march.
How?
Well, it’s…
It’s the rhythm.
Oh, you mean right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot?
What, you need help remembering that?
When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black, we won’t be banging on drums to let them know we’re coming.
No.
No, you’re just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you’re coming.
You know nothing, Jon Snow.
She’s right, you don’t.
I know you cut me loose on the Wall.
Cut her loose, too.
Do you see her sulking about it?
That’s because she understands the way things are.
And are you gonna share it with me, the deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?
People work together when it suits them.
They’re loyal when it suits them.
They love each other when it suits them.
And they kill each other when it suits them.
She knows that, you don’t.
Which is why you’ll never hold on to her.
That rain will cost us another day.
Frey will wait.
He knows we’re coming.
Lord Walder is prickly by nature.
If…
“Prickly”?
That what you call it?
Might be the least pleasant man I’ve ever met.
Yes, and that is why…
I’ve seen wet shits I liked better than Walder Frey.
Apologies, Your Grace.
I’ve spent too many years around lancers and pikemen.
I’ve spent two years nursing wounded men, watching them bleed and die.
I’m not afraid of wet shits.
Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight.
He can take it as he likes.
He’s getting the wedding he wanted.
He’s getting a wedding.
It was a king he wanted.
Edmure is the best match a Frey has had in the history of their house.
We should all get some sleep.
If you don’t put some clothes on, I can’t promise I won’t attack you again.
Attack.
Attack.
Who are you writing?
My mother.
Is that Valyrian?
Gaaa.
“Gaaa”?
Say hello for me.
Rytsas.
“Ritsas.
” That was close enough.
Does she know her daughter’s a queen?
Not yet.
That will be a surprise, I expect.
Many surprises for her.
How am I supposed to sit here planning a war when you’re over there, looking like that?
Will you come with me one day to Volantis?
When all this is over?
I will.
I promise.
I know she’d love to meet you.
And her grandchild.
What, now?
Are you certain?
Are you angry with me?
Angry?
You’re my queen.
And I have your little prince or princess inside me.
Maybe one of each.
Don’t get greedy.
Can you leave the war for one night?
I love you.
Do you hear me?
I love you.
Most men fuck like dogs.
No grace, no skill.
A few dozen thrusts, and done.
You need to be patient.
Give her time.
Your cock shouldn’t go near her till she’s slick as a baby seal.
And then you go inside, but slowly.
Don’t jam it in like you’re spearing a pig.
Come on!
Hey, come on.
You think he loves you, is that it?
What did he tell you?
He’s gonna make you his lady and live with you in some castle?
No, he didn’t tell me anything.
He barely talks.
I’ve seen you two whispering in the night, giggling like a pair of girls.
What, you’re jealous?
Of course I’m jealous.
You should be with one of your own.
And you’re one of my own?
I’ve never heard a kind word from your mouth.
You would if you were mine.
I’d tell you that you’re beautiful and fierce and wild.
I’d be good to you.
You love him?
‘Cause he’s pretty?
Is that it?
You like his pretty hair and his pretty eyes?
You think pretty is gonna make you happy?
Don’t touch me.
You won’t love him so much when you find out what he really is.
Growing up at Winterfell, all I ever wanted was to escape, to come here to the capital.
See the southern knights and their painted armour and King’s Landing after dark.
All the candles burning in all those windows.
I’m stupid.
A stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns.
Come on.
Come walk with me.
I remember the first time I saw you in the throne room.
I’d never seen anyone who looked so unhappy.
I want very much for you to be happy, Sansa, and so does my grandmother.
You would have been happy at Highgarden, but women in our position must make the best of our circumstances.
How do I make the best of my circumstances?
I have to marry him.
Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you?
No.
Has he been kind to you?
He’s tried.
You don’t want him, though.
He’s a Lannister.
Far from the worst Lannister, wouldn’t you say?
I’m sorry.
Here I am complaining to you…
My son will be king.
Sons learn from their mothers.
I plan to teach mine a great deal.
And your son, if I’m not mistaken, your son might be the Lord of Casterly Rock and the North someday.
What?
My son…
With him.
I’ll have to…
We’ll have to…
If it’s the pain you’re worried about…
I’m not afraid of the pain.
Not after what Joffrey’s done to me.
What is it, then?
He’s rather goodlooking, even with the scar.
Especially with the scar.
He’s a dwarf.
And Loras…
Loras.
Some women like tall men.
Some like short men.
Some like hairy men.
Some like bald men.
Gentle men, rough men, ugly men, pretty men, pretty girls.
Most women don’t know what they like until they’ve tried it.
And, sadly, so many of us get to try so little before we’re old and grey.
Tyrion may surprise you.
From what I’ve heard, he’s quite experienced.
And that’s a good thing?
It can be.
We’re very complicated, you know.
Pleasing us takes practice.
How do you know all this?
Did your mother teach you?
Yes, sweet girl.
My mother taught me.
She’s a child.
She’s a foot taller than you.
A tall child.
What’s the youngest you’ve ever had?
Not that young.
How much older?
Older.
You’re a lord, she’s a lady.
And a beauty, at that.
I don’t see the problem.
Shae isn’t going to like it.
Shae is a whore.
Are you gonna marry her, eh?
How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time?
I should never have told you about that.
You want Shae, keep her.
Wed one and bed the other.
All you have to do is get a son in the Stark girl.
He’ll be Lord of Winterfell one day.
You can rule the North in his name.
You’ll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own.
Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them.
You waste time trying to get people to love you, you’ll end up the most popular dead man in town.
You want to fuck that Stark girl.
You just don’t want to admit it.
I don’t pay you to put evil notions in my head.
The ones already there don’t need company.
You pay me to kill people who bother you.
Evil notions come free.
Your Grace.
Grandfather.
You wanted to speak to me?
Yes.
I’d like a report on the meetings of my Small Council.
You’re welcome to attend the meetings of your Small Council, Your Grace.
Any or all of them.
I’ve been very busy.
Many important matters require a king’s attention.
Of course.
You’ve been holding the council meetings in the Tower of the Hand instead of the Small Council chamber.
I have, yes.
May I ask why?
Well, the Tower of the Hand is where I work.
To walk from there to here would take time, time I could otherwise spend productively.
So if I wanted to attend a council meeting, I would now have to climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand?
We could arrange to have you carried.
Tell me about the Targaryen girl in the east and her dragons.
Where did you hear about this?
Is it true?
Apparently so.
Don’t you think we ought to do something about it?
When I was Hand of the King under your father’s predecessor, the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room.
The skull of the last of them was right here.
It was the size of an apple.
And the biggest was the size of a carriage.
Yes, and the creature to whom it belonged died years ago.
Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us.
But how do we know these dragons are just curiosities and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel?
Because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counselling the King on matters about which he knows nothing.
But I haven’t been counselled.
You are being counselled at this very moment.
I should be consulted about such things.
From now on, I will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on important matters whenever necessary.
Your Grace.
Yunkai.
The Yellow City.
The Yunkish train bed slaves, not soldiers.
We can defeat them.
On the field, with ease.
But they won’t meet us on the field.
They have provisions, patience, and strong walls.
If they’re wise, they’ll hide behind those walls and chip away at us, man by man.
I don’t want half my army killed before I’ve crossed the Narrow Sea.
We don’t need Yunkai, Khaleesi.
Taking this city will not bring you any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne.
How many slaves are there in Yunkai?
,, if not more.
Then we have , reasons to take the city.
Send a man to the city gates.
Tell the slavers I will receive them here, and accept their surrender.
Otherwise, Yunkai will suffer the same fate as Astapor.
Now comes the noble Razdal mo Eraz of that ancient and honourable house, Master of Men and Speaker to Savages, to offer terms of peace.
Noble lord, you are in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons.
You may approach.
Sit.
Will the noble lord take refreshment?
Ancient and glorious is Yunkai.
Our empire was old before dragons stirred in old Valyria.
Many an army has broken against our walls.
You shall find no easy conquest here, Khaleesi.
Good.
My Unsullied need practice.
I was told to blood them early.
If blood is your desire, blood shall flow.
But why?
‘Tis true you have committed savageries in Astapor, but the Yunkai are a forgiving and generous people.
The wise masters of Yunkai have sent a gift for the Silver Queen.
There is far more than this awaiting you on the deck of your ship.
My ship?
Yes, Khaleesi.
As I said, we are a generous people.
You shall have as many ships as you require.
And what do you ask in return?
All we ask is that you make use of these ships.
Sail them back to Westeros where you belong, and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace.
I have a gift for you as well.
Your life.
My life?
And the lives of your wise masters.
But I also want something in return.
You will release every slave in Yunkai.
Every man, woman, and child shall be given as much food, clothing, and property as they can carry as payment for their years of servitude.
Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy.
You are mad.
We are not Astapor or Qarth.
We are Yunkai, and we have powerful friends.
Friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you.
Those who survive, we shall enslave once more.
Perhaps we’ll make a slave of you as well.
You swore me safe conduct.
I did, but my dragons made no promises.
And you threatened their mother.
Take the gold.
My gold.
You gave it to me, remember?
And I shall put it to good use.
You’d be wise to do the same with my gift to you.
Now get out.
The Yunkish are a proud people.
They will not bend.
And what happens to things that don’t bend?
He said he had powerful friends.
Who was he talking about?
I don’t know.
Find out.
Chains?
Solid gold from the mines outside Lannisport.
Smithed in Casterly Rock.
Golden chains.
You could buy a ship with these.
Do I need a ship?
What?
Am I going somewhere?
Of course you’re not going anywhere.
So, am I invited to your wedding?
I didn’t ask for this marriage.
I didn’t want it.
No?
She’s a beautiful girl.
You said so yourself.
That doesn’t mean that…
This is duty, not desire.
Is that what you will tell yourself when you fuck her?
I don’t have a choice.
My father…
Does not rule the world.
We can still go across the Narrow Sea.
What would I do there?
Juggle?
I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock.
And I’m Shae the funny whore.
My feelings for you have not changed.
I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her.
While I empty her chamber pot and lick your cock when you’re bored?
I swear to you, it will not be like that.
No?
What will it be like?
I will buy you a good home somewhere in the city.
You will have fine clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants.
Any children we might have will be well provided for.
Children?
You think I want children who can never see their father?
Who would be killed in their sleep if their grandfather found out about them?
Listen.
Listen to me, my lady.
I’m not your lady.
You are.
You’ll always be my lady.
I’m your whore.
And when you are tired of fucking me, I will be nothing.
What happened?
Wildfire.
I should have been here.
After all the running and fighting, here I am, back where I started.
Do you miss it?
King’s Landing?
Your father’s house.
Never had a father.
Never wanted one.
Haven’t you ever wondered where your strength came from?
Your talent for fighting?
I’m lowborn.
As low as can be.
My mother was a tavern wench.
Mine was a slave.
So was I.
Bought and sold, scourged and branded, until the Lord of Light reached down, took me in his hand, and raised me up.
I was born in Flea Bottom.
Your blood is noble.
Are you saying my father, he was some lord or…
There.
Your father’s house.
I’m just a bastard.
The bastard of Robert of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men.
Why do you think the gold cloaks wanted you?
There is power in a king’s blood.
Come sit by the fire, child.
Not talking, eh?
That’s a first.
I don’t talk to traitors.
I didn’t like giving up the boy.
But you did.
You took the gold and you gave him up.
The Red God is the one true god.
You’ve seen his power.
When he commands, we obey.
He’s not my one true god.
No?
Who’s yours?
Death.
Spotted a Lannister raiding party.
How many?
No more than .
How far?
Less than a day’s ride south.
What do you say, boys?
Time for a lion hunt?
Yeah!
But what about Riverrun?
It’s not south.
It’s west of here.
It will still be west of here two days from now.
You swore.
To take you home, and I will.
But we need to do this first.
Why?
So you can steal their gold?
I swear to you, this isn’t…
I don’t care what you swear because you’re a liar.
You lied to Gendry, you lied to me.
You’ll lie to anyone.
I hope the Lannisters kill you all.
One day you’ll understand, but now…
Anguy, bring her back.
Come back, girl!
Kick all you like, wolf girl.
Won’t do you no good.
I thought you were gone.
Tomorrow.
Have they told you what they plan to do with me?
Lord Bolton’s travelling tomorrow as well.
He’s going to the Twins for Edmure Tully’s wedding.
You’re to remain here.
With Locke?
I owe you a debt.
When Catelyn Stark released you, we both made a promise to her.
Now it’s your promise.
You gave your word.
Keep it and consider the debt paid.
I will return the Stark girls to their mother.
I swear it.
Goodbye, Ser Jaime.
Here.
Let me.
It will take time.
Qyburn hopes your father will force the Citadel to give him back his chain.
My father will make him grand maester if he grows me a new hand.
You will give my regards to Lord Tywin, I trust?
Tell Robb Stark I’m sorry I couldn’t make his uncle’s wedding.
The Lannisters send their regards.
Safe journey, Kingslayer.
Nothing to say?
I liked you better before.
I don’t remember chopping your balls off, too.
Don’t you worry about your friend.
We’ll take good care of her.
Gentle, my lord.
Gentle.
Myranda knows what she’s doing.
Let her.
She trained as a septa, only…
She had other urges.
So did the septons, only they lied about it.
Where is he?
Who, my lord?
There’s no one here but you, me, and Violet.
Please.
Don’t you want us to see it?
Oh, come on.
Let us see it.
Everybody talks about it.
Who sent you?
Who sent us?
We sent ourselves, Lord Greyjoy.
We heard so much about it.
Please.
Oh!
There it is.
Oh…
Do you think we’re ugly?
He thinks we’re ugly.
Well, he’s been through so much.
Look at his poor face.
Help me.
If he comes back…
We need to make him feel better.
And how can we make him feel better?
I have an idea.
Aw!
She’s shy.
You know how they are, these religious girls.
Maybe he doesn’t know how we are.
I felt something.
Oh, Lord Greyjoy.
As good as they say?
Mmm.
And why should you get all the fun?
What?
You like her better?
Plenty there for both of us.
I was here first.
I’m sorry.
I’m sorry.
Terrible timing.
But I was getting jealous.
Well?
Should we see this cock everyone’s always going on about?
Everyone knows you love girls.
I bet you always thought they loved you back.
Your famous cock must be very precious to you.
Would you say it’s your most precious part?
Please.
No.
No!
Mercy, please!
Please, mercy!
Mercy!
This is mercy.
I’m not killing you.
Just making a few alterations.
No!
No!
No!
Please, no!
No!
No!
No, please!
Please!
You’re gonna scare it off.
I’m not gonna scare it.
I’m gonna kill it.
It’s too far away.
Is that a palace?
It’s a windmill.
Windmill.
Who built it?
Some king?
Just the men who used to live here.
They must have been great builders, stacking stones so high.
Winterfell has towers three times that size.
“Oh, I’m Jon Snow and I’m from Winterfell.
“My daddy was a fancy lord “and I lived in a tower that touched the clouds.
” If you’re impressed by a windmill, you’d be swooning if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell.
What’s swooning?
Fainting.
What’s fainting?
When a girl sees blood and collapses.
Why would a girl see blood and collapse?
Well…
Not all girls are like you.
Well, girls see more blood than boys.
Or do you like girls who swoon, Jon Snow?
Oh, a spider!
Save me, Jon Snow.
My dress is made of the purest silk from Tralalalaleeday.
I’d like to see you in a silk dress.
Would you?
So I could tear it off you.
Well, you rip my pretty silk dress, I’ll blacken your eye.
Maybe one day I’ll take you to Winterfell.
Or maybe one day I’ll take you there.
After we’ve taken our land back.
Ygritte.
You won’t win.
I know your people are brave, no one denies that.
You know nothing…
Six times in the last thousand years, a KingbeyondtheWall has attacked the kingdoms.
Six times they failed.
And how do you know that?
Every boy in the North knows it.
We grow up learning it.
Where the battles were fought, the heroes, who died where.
Six times you’ve invaded and six times you’ve failed.
The seventh will be the same.
Mance is different.
You don’t have the discipline.
You don’t have the training.
Your army is no army.
You don’t know how to fight together.
You don’t know that.
I do.
I know it.
If you attack the Wall, you’ll die.
All of you.
All of us.
You’re mine as I’m yours.
And if we die, we die.
But first we’ll live.
Yes, first we’ll live.
What’s he going on about?
And how come he always gets to sit and chat while we do all the work?
Hodor.
That’s where we are.
What are you telling him?
It’s all right, Osha.
It’s not all right.
You think I can’t hear you every day?
Filling his head with black magic.
Talking about visions and threeeyed ravens and worse.
Leave him alone.
He can speak for himself.
I don’t fill his head with anything.
So, what do you talk about?
What’s happening to him and what that means.
Go on, then.
Tell us what it means.
It’s not like that.
I wish I could tell him all the answers.
It would be much easier.
I don’t want you talking to him any more.
Until we get to your brother at Castle Black.
We’re not going to Castle Black.
What did you say?
I told you already.
Jon Snow isn’t there.
Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall.
Oh, no.
I’m not going back there.
Your brother is at Castle Black.
That’s where we’re going.
Look at me.
The raven’s been coming to me ever since I fell from that tower.
He wants me to find him.
I don’t have my legs any more.
This is what I have now.
You have a family.
You need to go back to Castle Black so you can get back to them, where you belong.
What if I belong in the North?
What if I fell from that tower for a reason?
Is that what he’s telling you?
That it’s all for a reason?
All these bad things happened because the Gods got big plans for you?
I wish it were true, little lord.
But the Gods wouldn’t spare a raven’s cold shit for you or me or anyone.
You don’t understand.
You don’t know.
You don’t know.
None of you know.
None of you have been up there.
I had a man once.
A good man.
Bruni, his name was.
I was his and he was mine.
But one night Bruni disappears.
People said he left me, but I knew him.
He’d never leave me.
Not for long.
I knew he’d come back.
And he did.
He came in through the back of the hut.
Only it wasn’t Bruni.
Not really.
His skin was pale like a dead man’s.
His eyes bluer than clear sky.
He came at me, grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard I could feel the life slipping out of me.
I don’t know how I got the knife.
When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart.
And he hardly seemed to notice.
I had to burn our hut down with him inside.
I didn’t ask the Gods what it meant.
I didn’t need to.
I already knew.
It meant the North was no place for men to be.
Not any more.
I promised your maester I’d get you to Castle Black and no further.
How is the pain, my lord?
What’s the purpose of an arm with no hand?
Well, we’ve stymied the corruption.
Yes, we’ve stymied the corruption.
You’re a learned man.
All the good it’s done me.
You did well sewing up this mess.
You’re far better at this sort of work than Grand Maester Pycelle.
Faint praise, my lord.
So, why did the Citadel take your chain?
Did you fondle one boy too many?
No, my lord.
That’s not my weakness.
What is?
Curiosity.
The only way to treat disease is to understand disease, and the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted.
You performed experiments on living men.
On dying men.
With their permission?
My studies have given me insight that has saved many lives.
Dying paupers, I assume.
Men with no families to complain.
You found them moaning in the poorhouse and had them carted back to your garret and opened up their bellies to see what was inside.
How many men have you killed, my lord?
I don’t know.
?
?
Countless.
“Countless” has a nice ring to it.
And how many lives have you saved?
Half a million.
The population of King’s Landing.
You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal.
Did you…
Did you get a bird off to Brienne’s father in Tarth?
A bird flew off and a bird flew back.
Lord Selwyn Tarth offered gold dragons for his daughter’s safe return.
A fair offer.
A fair offer.
Locke won’t take it.
Why not?
He’s convinced Lord Tarth owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros.
He feels he’s being cheated.
They’d be fools to kill her.
These men have been at war a long time.
Most of them will be dead by winter.
She’ll be their entertainment tonight.
Beyond tonight, I don’t think they care very much.
We have to return to Harrenhal.
Why?
I’ve left something behind.
Absolutely not.
I’ve got orders from Lord Bolton.
And what are those orders?
To deliver you to your father at King’s Landing.
You think you’ll get a reward.
I serve Lord Bolton.
Any appreciation your father…
You think you’re getting a reward.
Let me explain something to you.
When my father sees me, the first thing he’s going to ask is what happened to my hand, and I’m going to tell him this man chopped it off.
I had nothing…
Or I could tell him this man saved my life.
We return to Harrenhal.
Now.
Eyes open, lads.
Be quiet.
The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair From there to here, from here to there All black and brown and covered in hair He smelt that girl in the summer air The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair Don’t spare her.
Don’t spare her!
Well, this is one shameful fucking performance.
Stop running and fight.
A wooden sword?
I thought you’d gone.
You gave her a wooden sword!
We’ve only got one bear.
I’ll pay her bloody ransom.
Gold, sapphires, whatever you want.
Just get her out of there.
All you lords and ladies still think that the only thing that matters is gold.
This makes me happier than all your gold ever could.
And that makes me happier than all her sapphires.
So go buy yourself a golden hand and fuck yourself with it!
Get behind me.
I will not.
What the fuck are you doing to my bear?
Lord Bolton charged me with bringing him back to King’s Landing alive, and that’s what I aim to do.
Pull her up!
Hold my legs.
Pull him up!
The bitch stays.
We’re taking her to King’s Landing.
Unless you kill me.
She belongs to me.
Lord Bolton’s orders.
What do you think is more important to Lord Bolton?
Getting his pet rat a reward or ensuring Tywin Lannister gets his son back alive?
Well, we must be on our way.
Sorry about the sapphires.To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
I’ll give you one try, girl.
Kill me and you’re free.
But if I live, I’ll break both your hands.
Go on, hit me.
Hit me hard.
Sulk all you want.
The truth is, you’re lucky.
You don’t want to be alone out here, girl.
Someone worse than me would find you.
There’s no one worse than you.
You never knew my brother.
He once killed a man for snoring.
There’s plenty worse than me.
There’s men who like to beat little girls, men who like to rape them.
I saved your sister from some of them.
You’re lying.
Ask her, if you ever see her again.
Ask her who came back for her when the mob had her on her back.
They would have taken her every which way and left her there with her throat cut open.
Is that the Blackwater?
The Blackwater?
Where do you think I’m taking you?
Back to King’s Landing, to Joffrey and the Queen.
Fuck Joffrey.
Fuck the Queen.
That’s the Red Fork.
I’m taking you to the Twins.
But why?
Your mother and brother will be there, and they’ll pay me for you.
Why would they be at the Twins?
Those outlaws you love so much never told you?
The whole countryside is yapping about it.
Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls.
So quit trying to bash my skull in, and we might just make it there in time for the wedding.
Men who fight for gold have neither honour nor loyalty.
They cannot be trusted.
They can be trusted to kill you if they’re well paid.
The Yunkish are paying them well.
You know these men?
Only by the broken swords on their banners.
They’re called the Second Sons.
A company led by a Braavosi named Mero, the Titan’s Bastard.
Is he more titan or bastard?
He’s a dangerous man, Khaleesi.
They all are.
How many?
,, Your Grace.
Armoured and mounted.
Enough to make a difference?
It’s hard to collect wages from a corpse.
I’m sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side.
I imagine you’re right.
I’d like to talk to the Titan’s Bastard about winning.
He may not agree to meet.
He will.
A man who fights for gold can’t afford to lose to a girl.
Your Grace, allow me to present the captains of the Second Sons, Mero of Braavos, Prendahl na Ghezn, and, um…
Daario Naharis.
You are the Mother of Dragons?
I swear I fucked you once in a pleasure house in Lys.
Mind your tongue.
Why?
I didn’t mind hers.
She licked my ass like she was born to do it.
You, slave girl, bring wine.
We have no slaves here.
You’ll all be slaves after the battle, unless I save you.
Take your clothes off and come and sit on Mero’s lap, and I may give you my Second Sons.
Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded.
Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons?
Under ,, Your Grace.
We have more, don’t we?
, Unsullied.
I’m only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us.
I hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie.
You have , Unsullied.
You’re very young to be a captain.
He’s not a captain.
He’s a lieutenant.
Even if your numbers are right, the odds don’t favour your side.
The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won.
The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run.
Or you could fight for me.
We’ve taken the slavers’ gold.
We fight for Yunkai.
I would pay you as much and more.
Our contract is our bond.
If we break our bond, no one will hire the Second Sons again.
Ride with me and you’ll never need another contract.
You’ll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms.
You have no ships.
You have no siege weapons.
You have no cavalry.
A fortnight ago, I had no army.
A year ago, I had no dragons.
You have two days to decide.
Show me your cunt.
I want to see if it’s worth fighting for.
My Queen, shall I slice out his tongue for you?
These men are our guests.
You seem to be enjoying my wine.
Perhaps you’d like a flagon to help you ponder.
Only a flagon?
And what are my brothers in arms to drink?
A barrel, then.
Good.
The Titan’s Bastard does not drink alone.
In the Second Sons, we share everything.
After the battle, maybe we’ll all share you.
I’ll come looking for you when this is over.
Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first.
Gladly, Your Grace.
Half Robert, half lowborn.
Show the boy to his chambers.
Have the maids draw him a bath and find him some decent clothes.
I’ll come visit you soon.
What do you mean to do with him?
You know.
Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes?
If it needs to be done, do it.
Don’t torture the boy.
Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king?
No.
If the lamb sees the knife, she panics.
Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavour.
You’ve slaughtered many lambs?
And none have seen the blade.
“And though “Visenya “Targaryen “rode “Vhagar “Vhag…
” Fuck me.
“Visenya Targaryen “rode Vhagar, “the smallest of the dragons, “though still “large “enough “to swallow a horse whole.
” Your Grace.
They feeding you enough?
Two meals a day.
Cold for breakfast, hot for supper.
I cannot complain.
You don’t belong in a place like this.
Well, it’s sad to say, but I’ve seen worse.
Yeah.
I’m sorry about your son.
Didn’t get the chance to tell you before.
Good lad.
Loyal lad.
Melisandre’s returned.
I didn’t know she’d been gone.
Came back with a bastard boy.
Robert’s bastard boy.
Why?
She says there’s power in king’s blood.
She’s going to kill him.
Sacrifice him.
Forgive me, Your Grace, I’m not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice?
The boy is your nephew.
What of it?
We’re at war.
Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night?
Because he has your blood in his veins.
So did Renly.
Renly wronged you.
Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you.
He raised an army, stole your bannermen.
This boy has done you no harm.
He’s an innocent.
How many boys live in Westeros?
How many girls?
How many men?
How many women?
The darkness will devour them all, she says.
The night that never ends.
Unless I triumph.
I never asked for this.
No more than I asked to be king.
We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no?
Great or small, we must do our duty.
What’s one bastard boy against a kingdom?
Your Grace, why did you come to see me today?
I came to free you.
If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again.
I swear it.
I can’t swear never to speak against her.
You have little regard for your own life.
Quite little, Your Grace.
Verging on none.
You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew I’d counsel restraint.
You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself.
You’re not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory.
When my son was five, he said to me, “I don’t ever want to die.
” I wanted to say to him, “You won’t, child.
You won’t ever.
” I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid.
I think mothers and fathers made up the Gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night.
I saw a vision in the flames.
A great battle in the snow.
I saw it.
And you saw whatever she gave birth to.
I never believed, but when you see the truth, when it’s right there in front of you, as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real?
That dragon bitch.
She talks too much.
You talk too much.
She won’t talk so much when she’s choking on my cock.
, Unsullied stand between her and your cock.
My cock will find a way.
Tell him.
Is there any place that my cock can’t reach?
She’ll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me.
Daario Naharis, the whore who doesn’t like whores.
I like them very much.
I just refuse to pay them.
And I’m no whore, my friend.
She sells her sheath, and you sell your blade.
What’s the difference?
I fight for beauty.
For beauty?
We fight for gold.
The Gods gave men two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die, the thrill of fucking a woman who wants to be fucked and the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you.
You’ll die young.
What do we do about the dragon girl?
We can’t beat , Unsullied on the battlefield.
There won’t be a battle, and we don’t have to deal with her eunuchs.
We only have to deal with her.
She’s wellguarded.
Tonight’s a new moon.
One of us slips into her camp past her Unsullied and her knights.
Which one of us?
Close your eyes, love.
Three coins.
A coin from Meereen, a coin from Volantis, and a coin from Braavos.
The Braavosi does the deed.
One for each of us, darling.
No peeking.
Do you hear me?
Follow my voice.
I’m right here.
You have something for me?
Valar Morghulis.
Lady Sansa.
You look very handsome, my lord.
Oh, yes.
The husband of your dreams.
But you do look glorious.
Perhaps we could have a moment alone.
Do you mind?
Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark’s handmaiden?
My lady, I want you to know I didn’t ask for this.
I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord.
No, don’t.
You don’t have to speak to me as a prisoner any more.
You won’t be a prisoner after today.
You’ll be my wife.
I suppose that’s a different kind of prison.
I just wanted to say…
I’m just trying to say, very badly…
I just…
Just want to say I know how you feel.
I doubt that very much, my lord.
You’re right.
I have no idea how you feel.
And you have no idea how I feel.
But I promise you one thing, my lady.
I won’t ever hurt you.
Do you drink wine?
When I have to.
Well, today you have to.
You look radiant, Your Grace.
Radiant?
Why radiant?
It’s the word that came to mind.
We’re going to be sisters soon.
We should be friends.
You’re a musical girl, aren’t you?
I imagine you have a lovely voice.
A better dancer than a singer, I’m afraid.
But you know the song The Rains of Castamere?
Of course.
They play it so often here at court.
So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere?
Not as well as you, I’m sure.
House Reyne was a powerful family.
Very wealthy.
The second wealthiest in Westeros.
Aren’t the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now?
Ambitious climbers don’t want to stop on the second highest rung.
If only you could take that final step, you’d see further than all the rest.
You’d be alone with nothing but blue sky above you.
So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock.
He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore.
And finally one day, he rebelled against my father.
Do you know where House Reyne is now?
Gone.
Gone.
A gentle word.
Why not say “slaughtered”?
Every man, woman, and child put to the sword.
I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock.
My father let them rot up there all summer.
It was a long summer.
“And now the rains weep o’er their halls, and not a soul to hear.
” If you ever call me “sister” again, I’ll have you strangled in your sleep.
What are you doing?
Your father’s gone.
As the father of the realm, it is my duty to give you away to your husband.
You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.
Uh…
Could you…
Thank you.
Your Grace, Your Grace, my lords, my ladies, we stand here in the sight of gods and men to witness the union of man and wife.
One flesh, one heart, one soul, now and forever.
Have you ever seen one like it?
I’ve never seen anything like any of this.
Not in my life.
It’s shocking, isn’t it, the first time you encounter real wealth?
When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day.
And stew is a kind word for it.
In Flea Bottom we called them “bowls of brown.
” We’d pretend that the meat in them was chicken.
We knew it wasn’t chicken.
Here, taste this.
You think I’m trying to poison you?
That’s good.
That’s really good.
Where do you think it’s from?
I couldn’t even guess.
Doesn’t matter, does it?
It’s the real thing or it’s not.
You only need a tongue to tell the difference.
Go on, have some more.
You still don’t trust it.
You think this is all a mistake that you have to pay for every bite you take.
That thought had crossed my mind, yeah.
There are no mistakes.
Not for us.
I’m a mistake.
I’m only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern.
Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it.
He willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you can’t even begin to understand.
And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world.
We’re both a part of His plan.
He wants this for us.
No, He demands this of us.
I don’t understand.
This…
This doesn’t seem very religious.
According to whom?
The Silent Sisters?
With their stern looks, muzzled mouths, and driedup cunts?
What have their gods done for you?
Mmm?
When you pray to them, what’s their answer?
A god is real or he’s not.
You only need eyes to see.
Death is coming for everyone and everything.
A darkness that will swallow the dawn.
And we can stop it, you and I.
Let me show you what you have inside you.
Come fight death with me.
What are you doing?
You have to trust me.
What…
Get it away.
Get it off me.
Don’t fight, don’t fight.
They won’t take much.
Why are you doing this?
I told you there’s power in the blood of kings.
And you have so much blood.
No.
No, no, no, no!
Not there.
Not there!
You can blame Ser Davos.
He didn’t believe in the power of king’s blood.
He wanted a demonstration.
Please.
Please, Your Grace.
My lord!
The usurper Robb Stark.
The usurper Balon Greyjoy.
The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
So their son will be your nephew.
After you’re wed to Cersei, of course.
And you will be the King’s stepfather and brotherinlaw.
When you marry the King, Joffrey’s mother will become his sisterinlaw and your son will be Loras’ nephew?
Grandson?
I’m not sure.
But your brother will become your fatherinlaw.
That much is beyond dispute.
Will you pardon me, my lord?
Of course.
Of course.
Enjoy.
Perhaps you could talk to your bridetobe instead.
I’ve got a lifetime for that.
Stay.
You seem rather drunk.
Rather less than I plan to be.
Isn’t it a man’s duty to be drunk at his own wedding?
This isn’t about your wedding.
Renly Baratheon had a wedding.
Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible.
And?
If you’re going to give her one, you need to perform.
What did you once call me?
A drunken little lustfilled beast.
More than once.
There you have it.
Nothing to worry about.
Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things.
I am the god of tits and wine.
I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit.
You can drink, you can joke, you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable, but you will do your duty.
Well…
My father once told me…
Nobody cares what your father once told you.
Congratulations, my lady.
Thank you, Your Grace.
Well, you’ve done it.
You’ve married a Lannister.
Soon you’ll have a Lannister baby.
It’s a dream come true for you, isn’t it?
What a glorious day.
Yes, Your Grace.
I suppose it doesn’t really matter which Lannister puts the baby into you.
Maybe I’ll pay you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out.
How’d you like that?
You wouldn’t?
That’s all right.
Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down.
Time for the bedding ceremony.
Ah!
There will be no bedding ceremony.
Where’s your respect for tradition, Uncle?
Come, everyone.
Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed.
Get rid of her gown.
She won’t be needing it any longer.
Ladies, attend to my uncle.
He’s not heavy.
There will be no bedding ceremony.
There will be if I command it.
Then you’ll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock.
What did you say?
What did you say?
I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace.
I’m sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the King.
A bad joke, Your Grace.
Made out of envy of your own royal manhood.
Mine is so small.
My poor wife won’t even know I’m there.
Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace.
I am.
Guilty.
But…
But it is my wedding night.
My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do.
Come, wife.
I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act.
Not proud of it.
But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don’t you agree?
Come, I’ll tell you all about it.
Put you in the mood.
Is that wise, my lord?
Tyrion, Sansa.
My name is Tyrion.
Is that wise, Tyrion?
Nothing was ever wiser.
Astoundingly long.
What?
Neck.
You have one.
How old are you exactly?
.
Well, talk won’t make you any older.
My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage.
Stop.
I can’t.
I could, I won’t.
But your father…
If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start.
I won’t share your bed.
Not until you want me to.
What if I never want you to?
And so my watch begins.
Nineteen?
Yes, Your Grace.
How can anyone speak languages?
It only took Your Grace a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well.
Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope…
What do you mean, “reasonably well”?
Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master.
So guttural and harsh.
Drogo said I spoke Dothraki like one born to it.
It gave him great pride.
Athjahakar.
Athjahaka.
Athjahakar.
Athjahakar.
Well, I suppose I’m a bit out of practice.
Your High Valyrian is very good, Your Grace.
The Gods could not devise a more perfect tongue.
It is the only proper language for poetry.
No screaming, or she dies.
What do you want?
You.
Let her go.
Don’t scream, lovely girl.
You were sent here to kill me?
So why haven’t you?
I don’t want to.
What do your captains have to say about that?
You should ask them.
Why?
We had philosophical differences.
Over what?
Your beauty.
It meant more to me than it did to them.
You’re a strange man.
I’m the simplest man you’ll ever meet.
I only do what I want to do.
And this is supposed to impress me?
Yes.
Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades?
They ordered me to murder you.
I told them I preferred not to.
They told me I had no choice.
I told them I am Daario Naharis.
I always have a choice.
They drew their swords and I drew mine.
Will you fight for me?
Swear to me.
The Second Sons are yours, and so is Daario Naharis.
My sword is yours, my life is yours, my heart is yours.
You really ought to knock.
I brought your breakfast.
It’s getting dark.
We could stay here for the night.
How hard can it be to build a fire?
It doesn’t matter.
Come under the furs.
We can keep each other warm.
He winked at me before.
I doubt it.
I saw him wink at me.
He blinked.
I suppose it’s a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink.
A what?
Well, I mean, there’s no real difference.
A wink is on purpose.
You thought of a name yet?
It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name.
Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me?
What?
No.
This is just the way I talk.
I’ll build that fire.
Don’t you think he should have a name?
I don’t know many boys’ names.
Let’s see, there’s Duncan, Kevan, Jon…
Guymon, Feldan, Tristifer.
Craster.
Uh…
Yes.
Maybe that’s not…
Mormont.
That’s a lovely idea, but Mormont’s a last name.
Why is it a last name?
Well, it’s a family name.
For instance, I’m Samwell Tarly.
Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name.
You see?
So my father is also a Tarly.
His name is Samwell Tarly, too?
No, Randyll Tarly.
Randyll is a handsome name.
Please don’t name him Randyll.
Is your father cruel, like mine?
Different manner of cruel.
Not Randyll, then.
Don’t.
Don’t go out there.
I’ll be back.
I just want to look.
Go inside.
Go back inside.
I’ll…
It’s come for the baby.
Stay back!
You stay back!
No, you can’t have him!
No!
No!To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
Are you sure about this?
No.
It’s dangerous.
If we take Tywin’s castle from him, the lords of Westeros will realise he’s not invincible.
Take his home, take his gold, take his power.
Why are you telling me?
You begged me not to send Theon to negotiate with his father, and I ignored your advice.
Now Winterfell is burnt to the ground, the North is overrun with ironborn, and Bran and Rickon are gone.
So, Casterly Rock…
I’m asking your advice.
We have enough men?
If Walder Frey cooperates.
If Walder Frey cooperates.
If reinforcements arrive from King’s Landing before we take the castle, we’ll be caught between Tywin’s army and the sea.
We’ll lose the war and die the way Father died.
Or worse.
Show them how it feels to lose what they love.
My honoured guests, be welcome within my walls and at my table.
I extend to you my hospitality and protection in the light of the Seven.
We thank you for your hospitality, my lord.
I have come to make my apologies, my lord, and to beg your forgiveness.
Don’t beg my forgiveness, Your Grace.
It wasn’t me you spurned.
It was my girls.
One of them was supposed to be queen.
Now none of them are.
This is Arwyn, my daughter.
My daughter Walda, my daughter Derwa, my daughter Waldra.
My eldest granddaughters Ginia and Neila.
Serra and Sarra, granddaughters, twins.
You could have had either.
Could have had both, for all I care.
My granddaughter Marianne.
My granddaughter Freya.
My granddaughter…
Wertha.
Waldra.
Waldina.
I’m Merry.
Fine.
And here’s my youngest daughter Shirei, though she hasn’t bled yet.
Clearly you don’t have the patience for all that.
My ladies.
All men should keep their word, kings most of all.
I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow.
The fault is not with you.
Any man would be lucky to have any one of you.
I did what I did not to slight you, but because I loved another.
I know these words cannot set right the wrong I have done to you and your house.
I beg your forgiveness and pledge to do all I can to make amends so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends.
Very good.
There she is.
Come closer.
Let me have a look at you.
Still can’t see you.
Old eyes.
Love.
That’s what the Starks of Winterfell call it, eh?
Very honourable.
I call it a pretty face.
Mmm.
Very pretty.
Prettier than this lot, that’s for sure.
Very shapely as well.
Oh, you try to hide her under that dress.
If you wanted to hide her, you shouldn’t have brought her here in the first place.
I can always see what’s going on beneath a dress.
Been at this a long time.
I bet when you take that dress off, everything stays right where it is.
Doesn’t drop an inch.
Your king says he betrayed me for love.
I say he betrayed me for firm tits and a tight fit.
And I can respect that.
When I was your age, I’d have broken oaths to get into that without a second thought.
Well, I’ve enough room in the hall for you lot.
We’ll set up tents outside with food and ale for the rest of your men.
Thank you, my lord.
Well, let’s get ready.
The wine will flow red and the music will play loud and we’ll put this mess behind us.
Where?
There.
There.
It’s a back gate.
My men use it when they visit Yunkai’s bed slaves.
Your men, but not you?
I have no interest in slaves.
A man cannot make love to property.
This is where we enter the city.
Very few guards.
They know me.
They let me inside…
We’re not gonna sneak an army through a back gate.
I kill the guards.
I take your two best men and lead them through the back streets, which I know well, and open the front gates.
Then comes the army.
Once the walls are breached, the city will fall in hours.
Or perhaps you’ll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter, cutting the head off our army.
The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee and you won’t have to split it three ways ’cause you’ve already slaughtered your partners.
You have a very suspicious mind.
In my experience, only dishonest people think this way.
You command the Unsullied.
What do you think?
You are a leader now.
Do you trust him?
I trust him.
You leave tonight.
Very good.
We’ll prepare.
Ser Jorah.
You can use an extra sword.
You’re the Queensguard, Ser Barristan.
Your place is by the Queen.
If we are truly her loyal servants, we’ll do whatever needs to be done, no matter the cost, no matter our pride.
We’re west of Castle Black, but the Nightfort’s closest to us.
It was the first castle on the Wall.
The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I.
Too big.
Impossible to maintain.
Other than Castle Black itself, the Nightfort’s the perfect castle for us.
It’s got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself.
No one’s used it in centuries, most likely.
It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort, if one knows how to find it, which, it just so happens, I do.
How do you know all that?
I read about it in a very old book.
You know all that from staring at marks on paper?
Yes.
You’re like a wizard.
Our father used to tell us that no wildling ever looked upon the Wall and lived.
Here we are.
Alive.
Remember what happens to children who run.
I’m your father and I’ll do the talking.
The roads have gone right to hell.
Cracked three spokes this morning.
Need a hand?
Need about eight hands.
Oh!
Got to get this salt pork to the Twins in time for the wedding.
Many thanks.
Don’t!
Don’t kill him.
Dead rats don’t squeak.
You’re so dangerous, aren’t you?
Saying scary things to little girls.
Killing little boys and old people.
A real hard man you are.
More than anyone you know.
You’re wrong.
I know a killer.
A real killer.
That so?
You’d be like a kitten to him.
He’d kill you with his little finger.
That him?
No.
Good.
Don’t kill him.
Please.
Please don’t.
You’re very kind.
Someday it’ll get you killed.
Where are we?
The Gift, I think.
Brandon the Builder gave all this land south of the Wall to the Night’s Watch for their sustenance and support.
Maester Luwin taught me that.
Doesn’t seem to be supporting anyone at the moment.
It’s good land, and there’s no war up here.
Why leave?
Wildlings.
Sorry.
But they come over the Wall and raid, steal, carry off women.
Old Nan said they turn your skull into a cup and make you drink your own blood from it.
That’s what Old Nan said.
There’s a storm coming.
I don’t see any.
It’s as good a place to shelter as any.
We can drink some blood while we wait.
I don’t need much.
Only one old man and eight good horses.
What’s one old man doing with eight horses?
He breeds them for the Watch.
How’s he keep folks from stealing them?
The Watch protects him.
Not today, they don’t.
He’s selling horses, he’s got some gold in there.
And proper steel.
Let’s carve him up.
We just take the horses and go.
The old man’s no threat.
I keep telling you.
He’s an old man.
A spear through the heart’s a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear.
The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief.
They’ll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.
I hope so.
Killing crows in their castle is tough.
Killing them out here in the open, that’s what we do.
Spread out.
Surround the hut and move in.
Ygritte!
Clear the barn!
No one’s going to believe you’re a hog farmer if you eat them all.
Best part of the animal.
Don’t worry.
They’re still there.
I know they’re still there.
You check every five minutes like you’re afraid they’re gonna move.
I’m not afraid.
Of course you are.
You’re almost there and you’re afraid you won’t make it.
The closer you get, the worse the fear gets.
No point in trying to hide behind that face.
I know fear when I see it.
Seen it a lot.
I knew fear when I saw it in you.
You’re afraid of fire.
When Beric’s sword went up in flames, you looked like a scared little girl.
And I know why, too.
I heard what your brother did to you.
Pressed your face to the fire like you’re a nice juicy mutton chop.
That give you some ideas?
Might do.
Go ahead, then.
You might get away.
Might even make it there on your own.
They’re just over the river.
The closest you’ve been to family since Ilyn Payne snipped your daddy’s neck.
Someday I’ll put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull.
How are we going to get past the Wall?
My uncle said it’s feet high.
How did you get past it?
Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals.
It would take us two months to get to the Bay of Seals.
Some climb straight up the ice.
Even Hodor’s not strong enough to climb the Wall with me on his back.
Hodor.
Nineteen castles guard the Wall.
Only three are still manned.
Hodor!
One of those abandoned fortresses will give us a way through.
My uncle said the gates were sealed with ice and stone when the castles were deserted.
Well, we’ll have to open them up again.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
There’s a rider out there.
Just one?
There’s more.
Hodor!
It’s just thunder, sweet giant.
Hodor.
I yield.
I yield.
Wildlings.
Where’s Shaggydog and Summer?
Hunting.
Hodor!
Shh.
Quiet, Hodor.
Hodor!
Make him shut up.
If they hear us…
Hush, Hodor.
No…
No more Hodoring.
Hodor!
Hodor!
Hodor, calm down.
You need to keep quiet.
They’re gonna hear us.
Hodor, be quiet.
Hodor!
Hodor, calm down.
Hodor!
Hodor!
Hodor, be quiet!
What did you do?
Nothing.
I don’t know.
What’s that?
That’s a horse dying.
Bring them over here.
That was the last of them.
The rest are dead.
I heard shouting up there.
Thunder.
I know the difference between shouting and thunder.
Maybe it’s ghosts.
That won’t help you, grandpa.
Where you riding?
Doesn’t matter now, does it?
No, it doesn’t matter now.
Cut his throat, or he’ll tell the crows we’re here.
You understand.
Let me stand at least.
Let me go with a bit of dignity.
Make the crow kill him.
You’re one of us now.
Prove it.
The wolves are out there.
I can’t do it by choice.
I don’t know how.
It happens in my dreams.
You’re a warg, Bran.
It’s in your blood.
I can’t.
You just did, with him.
A wolf is nothing compared to that.
She looks sharp.
Do it.
Do it.
I told you.
He’s still one of them.
Go on, boy.
Go on!
He’s a crow.
He’ll always be a crow.
And here’s his crow wife guarding him.
He’ll stab us in the back first chance he gets.
Kill him.
He’s one of them.
No!
Do you hear me?
Ahh!
You’re not gonna die for one of them.
Do it.
They’ll find us if you don’t.
You were right the whole time.
When you hear a songbird’s whistle, you come.
I’m a great whistler.
The greatest in the land.
Daario Naharis.
That one was quick.
There may be others.
I doubt it.
The Yunkish prefer to let their slaves do their fighting for them.
That’s what you call a few guards?
Come on!
What do you got, huh?
Lord Edmure, I hope I’m not a disappointment to you.
You’re a delight to me, my lady.
You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.
In the sight of the Seven, I hereby seal these two souls, binding them as one for eternity.
Look upon each other and say the words.
Father, Smith…
Father, Smith…
…
Warrior, Mother…
…
Warrior, Mother…
…
Maiden, Crone, Stranger.
…
Maiden, Crone, Stranger.
I am hers…
I am his…
…
and she is mine…
…
and he is mine…
from this day until the end of my days.
Is that safe?
They’re long gone.
You were right.
I can get inside Summer’s mind whenever I want.
Of course you can.
North of the Wall there are wildlings who can control all sorts of animals.
But you did a lot more than that.
You got inside Hodor’s mind.
They can’t do that north of the Wall?
No one can do that.
Anywhere.
When I was looking through Summer’s eyes, I saw Jon.
Where?
He was with the wildlings.
They tried to kill him, but he got away.
He’ll be heading back to Castle Black, then.
That’s where we should go.
For all we know, Castle Black’s already under attack.
If this many wildlings got through…
I already told you.
I’m not going north of the Wall.
Everything Jojen told me is true.
You saw what I did to Hodor.
I have to find the threeeyed raven.
Listen to me, little lord.
Don’t worry.
I’m not asking you to come with me.
It won’t be safe for Rickon.
Me?
I’m coming with you.
No.
You and Osha and Shaggydog head for the Last Hearth.
The Umbers are our bannermen.
They’ll protect you.
I’m coming with you.
I’m your brother.
I have to protect you.
Right now I have to protect you.
Robb’s at war and I’m going beyond the Wall.
If something happens to us, you’re the heir to Winterfell.
Would you know how to find the Last Hearth?
You Southerners build your big castles and you never move.
You’re easy to find.
We’re not Southerners.
And I don’t want to leave you.
Shh!
Come here, little soldier.
You and me, we’re gonna have some adventures.
You don’t have to do any of this.
Your family took me in and was good to me without cause.
We’ll be fine, you and me.
The Umbers are great warriors.
Even I heard about them growing up.
They’ll teach you how to swing a sword.
I know how to swing a sword.
You’re leaving now?
It’s the middle of the night.
I learned to walk in darkness.
Say your goodbyes, little man.
Keep this one safe.
He means the world to me.
We’ve been waiting a long time.
Haven’t we?
Well, I don’t know, you tell me.
How long does it take to sack a city?
It was just as you said.
They did not believe until it was too late.
Their slave soldiers threw down their spears and surrendered.
And Daario Naharis?
The city is yours, my queen.
They’re good, aren’t they?
They ought to be because they cost enough.
Look at the crowd there.
He complained about this marriage the entire ride from Riverrun, and now look at him.
The Gods love to reward a fool.
Uncle.
What?
He’s my nephew.
I love him.
And he’s a damned fool.
Don’t you drink, Lord Bolton?
Never do, my lady.
Dulls the senses.
That’s the point.
Didn’t you marry one of these Frey girls?
Aye.
Lord Walder let me choose any of his granddaughters and promised me the girl’s weight in silver as a dowry.
So I have a fat young bride.
I hope she makes you very happy.
Well, she’s made me very rich.
Pardon, my lord, my lady.
I need to find a tree to piss on.
My mother’s alone with Roose Bolton.
I should rescue her.
Your mother is less in need of rescue than any woman I’ve ever met.
Be kind.
She’s finally starting to like you.
And I like her.
But if she had her way, I would be back in Volantis playing my harp and you would be sitting over there, eating blackberries out of Roslin Frey’s hand.
Perhaps I’ve made a terrible mistake.
Striking your king is an act of treason.
No, don’t.
Don’t insult them.
Your Grace.
The septon has prayed his prayers, some words were said, and Lord Edmure has wrapped my daughter in a cloak.
But they are not yet man and wife.
A sword needs a sheath.
And a wedding needs a bedding.
What does my sire say?
To bed!
To bed!
To bed!
If you think the time is right, Lord Walder, by all means, let us bed them.
To bed!
To bed!
To bed!
Go on.
Hoho!
Careful now, ladies.
Once you set that monster free, there’s no caging him again.
To bed!
To bed!
To bed!
Poor girl.
Every bride suffers the same.
I’m sure you endured yours with grace.
Oh, Ned forbade it.
He said it wouldn’t be right if he broke a man’s jaw on our wedding night.
That is a very strange custom.
I suppose it does seem strange from a foreigner’s perspective.
It seems normal to you?
It’s a tradition.
Without the bedding ceremony, there’s no real proof the lord and lady consummated their marriage.
No, but there are other ways of providing proof.
Boy or girl?
I don’t know.
But if it’s a boy, I know what we should name him.
Oh, do you?
It seems to me the father should have some say in his son’s naming.
Eddard.
Don’t you want to teach little Ned Stark how to ride horses?
I do.
Go on, line ’em up!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?
Got salt pork for the feast.
The feast is over.
Doesn’t sound like it’s over.
If I tell you it’s over, it’s over.
Turn this cart around and get the hell out of here.
Got pig’s feet, too.
Are you soft in the head?
Turn this cart around.
Your Grace.
I feel I’ve been remiss in my duties.
I’ve given you meat and wine and music, but I haven’t shown you the hospitality you deserve.
My king has married and I owe my new queen a wedding gift.
Robb!
Ohh!
Ahh!
Ahh!
You ready to head home to Winterfell, eh?
Feast over yet, is it?
Aye, it’s over.
Aim!
It’s too late.
The King in the North arises.
Lord Walder!
Lord Walder, enough!
Let it end!
Please.
He is my son.
My first son.
Let him go, and I swear that we will forget this.
I swear it by the Old Gods and New.
We will take no vengeance.
You already swore me one oath right here in my castle.
You swore by all the Gods your son would marry my daughter!
Take me for a hostage, but let Robb go.
Robb, get up.
Get up and walk out.
Please!
Please!
And why would I let him do that?
On my honour as a Tully, on my honour as a Stark, let him go, or I will cut your wife’s throat.
I’ll find another.
Mother.

Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
What are you doing?
I have a list.
A list of people you mean to kill?
For laughing at me?
Do I look like Joffrey to you?
No, death seems a bit extreme.
Fear of death, on the other hand…
You should learn to ignore them.
My lady, people have been laughing at me far longer than they’ve been laughing at you.
I’m the halfman, the Demon Monkey, the Imp.
You’re a Lannister.
I am the disgraced daughter of the traitor Ned Stark.
The disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey.
We’re perfect for each other.
So how should we punish them?
Who?
Whom?
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
Ah!
I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions.
Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.
I hear that you’re a pervert.
I am the Imp.
I have certain standards to maintain.
We could sheep shift Lord Desmond’s bed.
You cut a little hole in his mattress and you stuff sheep dung inside.
Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again.
His room will stink, but he won’t know where it’s coming from.
Lady Sansa!
My sister used to do that when she was angry with me.
And she was always angry with me.
Why “sheep shift”?
That’s the vulgar word for “dung.
” My lady…
Well, you asked me.
That’s him!
My lord, my lady.
Your father has called a meeting of the Small Council.
Killed a few puppies today?
Show him.
Come on, show him.
Oh!
Apologies, my lord.
Old fingers.
“Roslin caught a fine fat trout.
“Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding.
” Signed, “Walder Frey.
” Is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something?
Robb Stark is dead.
And his bitch mother.
Write back to Lord Frey.
Thank him for his service and command him to send Robb Stark’s head.
I’m going to serve it to Sansa at my wedding feast.
Your Grace, Lady Sansa is your aunt by marriage.
A joke.
Joffrey did not mean it.
Yes, I did.
I’m going to have it served to Sansa at my wedding feast.
No.
She is no longer yours to torment.
Everyone is mine to torment.
You’d do well to remember that, you little monster.
Oh, I’m a monster.
Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then.
Monsters are dangerous, and just now kings are dying like flies.
I could have your tongue out for saying that.
Let him make his threats.
Hmm?
He’s a bitter little man.
Lord Tyrion should apologise immediately.
Unacceptable, disrespectful, and in very bad taste.
I am the King!
I will punish you.
Any man who must say, “I am the King,” is no true king.
I’ll make sure you understand that when I’ve won your war for you.
My father won the real war.
He killed Prince Rhaegar.
He took the crown while you hid under Casterly Rock!
The King is tired.
See him to his chambers.
Come along.
I’m not tired.
We have so much to celebrate.
A wedding to plan.
You must rest.
Grand Maester, perhaps some essence of nightshade to help him sleep.
I’m not tired!
Come.
Not you.
You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper.
You’re a fool if you believe he’s the most powerful man in Westeros.
A treasonous statement.
Joffrey is King.
You really think a crown gives you power?
No.
I think armies give you power.
Mmmhmm.
Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same.
Mmmhmm.
Oh, I know.
Walder Frey gets all the credit.
Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance.
Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man?
No.
He never would have risked such an action if he didn’t have certain assurances.
Which he got from me.
Do you disapprove?
I’m all for cheating.
This is war.
But to slaughter them at a wedding…
Explain to me why it is more noble to kill , men in battle than a dozen at dinner.
So that’s why you did it?
To save lives?
To end the war.
To protect the family.
Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks?
Go ahead, write one.
I’m in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood.
The Northerners will never forget.
Good.
Let them remember what happens when they march on the South.
All the Stark men are dead.
Winterfell is a ruin.
Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North until your son by Sansa comes of age.
I believe you still have some work to do on that score.
Do you think she’ll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?
One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant.
I will not rape her.
Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?
Use small words.
I’m not as bright as you.
The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first.
A good man does everything in his power to better his family’s position, regardless of his own selfish desires.
Does that amuse you?
No, it’s a very good lesson.
Only it’s easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you’re making all the decisions.
Easy for me, is it?
When have you ever done something that wasn’t in your interest, but solely for the benefit of the family?
The day that you were born.
I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away.
Instead, I let you live.
And I brought you up as my son.
Because you’re a Lannister.
Sansa.
It’s empty.
Let’s find a place to sleep.
Hodor.
Hodor.
Don’t, Hodor.
Maybe we shouldn’t stay here.
You’d rather be out there?
There are a lot of stories about this place.
Horrible stories.
I always quite liked the horrible stories.
So did I.
Once.
You ever heard about the Rat Cook?
No.
Who’s he?
Just a cook in the Night’s Watch.
He was angry at the King for something, I don’t remember.
When the King was visiting the Nightfort, the cook killed the King’s son, cooked him into a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms, and bacon.
That night he served the pie to the King.
He liked the taste of his son so much, he asked for a second slice.
The Gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young.
He’s been roaming the Nightfort ever since, devouring his own babies.
But no matter what he does, he’s always hungry.
If the Gods turned every killer into a giant white rat…
It wasn’t for murder the Gods cursed the Rat Cook or for serving the King’s son in a pie.
He killed a guest beneath his roof.
That’s something the Gods can’t forgive.
“The late Walder Frey,” old Tully called me because I didn’t get my men to the Trident in time for battle.
He thought he was witty.
Look at us now, Tully.
You’re dead, your daughter’s dead, your grandson’s dead, your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon, and I’m Lord of Riverrun.
The Blackfish escaped.
An old man on the run with no allies.
I have Tywin Lannister backing me.
Who does he have?
As you say.
They all laughed at me, all those high lords.
They all thought they were better than me.
Ned Stark, Hoster Tully.
People snigger when I marry a young girl, but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?
You’ll be needing a new young girl.
Yeah.
Got that to look forward to.
Hmm.
And you, the Warden of the North.
No more Starks to bow and scrape to.
Must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country.
He ignored my advice at every turn.
If he’d been a trifle less arrogant…
Calling himself the “Young Wolf.
” How’s that for pomposity?
Well, here’s to the Young Wolf!
Forever young.
Will you move to Winterfell now that the war’s over?
At some point perhaps.
But Winterfell’s in ruins.
Yeah.
What happened up there?
I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place.
I heard he killed all the ravens.
And after that, nothing.
I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out.
Robb Stark offered amnesty for the ironborn if they gave us Theon.
Oh.
And?
Ramsay delivered the terms.
The ironborn turned on Theon, as we knew they would.
They handed him over trussed and hooded.
But Ramsay, well…
Ramsay has his own way of doing things.
Well, the girls weren’t lying.
You had a goodsized cock.
What?
No.
Pork sausage.
You think I’m some sort of savage?
People talk about phantom limbs.
An amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be.
So I’ve always wondered, do eunuchs have a phantom cock?
Next time you think about naked girls, will you feel an itch?
Sorry.
I shouldn’t make jokes.
My mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples.
But my father taught me to aim for their head.
Kill me.
Sorry, what?
Kill me.
A little louder.
Kill me!
You’re no good to me dead.
We need you.
You don’t look like a Theon Greyjoy any more.
That’s a name for a lord.
But you’re not a lord, are you?
You’re just meat.
Stinking meat.
You reek.
Reek!
That’s a good name for you.
What’s your name?
Theon Greyjoy.
What’s your name?
Theon Greyjoy.
Please.
What is your name?
Reek.
My name is…
Reek.
Hodor.
Don’t kill me!
Who are you?
Sam!
Sam!
Who are you?
Gilly.
Don’t hurt us.
Where are you going?
To Castle Black.
I’m a brother of the Night’s Watch.
My brother, he’s in the Night’s…
Who’s your brother?
Doesn’t matter.
You’re Jon’s brother.
The one who fell from the window.
No, I’m not.
I’ve been around Ghost enough to know a direwolf when I see one.
And I’ve heard all about Hodor.
Hodor.
I’d be dead if it wasn’t for Jon.
If you’re his brother, you’re my brother, too.
And anything I can do to help you, I will.
Take us north of the Wall.
What?
Why in the world would you want to go…
I don’t want to.
I have to.
How did you get through the Wall?
Does the well lead to an underground river?
Is that how you came here?
Come with us.
There are steps carved into the south side of the Wall.
Hodor can carry you to the top.
We’ll walk straight to Castle Black.
Come with us.
There’s nothing north but death.
If Jon is alive, then Castle Black’s where he’ll be.
It’s the safest place for you.
There’s nowhere safe any longer.
You know that.
What I know is what I saw.
And if you saw it, too, you’d run the other way.
You saw the White Walkers and the army of the dead.
How do you know all that?
The Night’s Watch can’t stop them.
The Kings of Westeros and all their armies can’t stop them.
But you’re going to stop them?
Please, Sam.
I have to go north.
I have to.
“Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands and invader of the North.
“I give you until the full moon “to order all ironborn scum out of the North “and back to those shitstained rocks you call a home.
“On the first night of the full moon, “I will hunt down every islander “still in our lands and flay them living, “the way I flayed the ironborn scum I found at Winterfell.
“In the box you’ll find a special gift…
“Theon’s favourite toy.
“He cried when I took it away from him.
“Leave the North now, or more boxes will follow “with more Theon.
” Signed, “Ramsay Snow, naturalborn son of Roose Bolton, “Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North.
” Get that out of my sight.
Theon disobeyed my orders.
The boy is a fool.
He cannot further the Greyjoy line.
I will not give up the lands I have seized, the strongholds I have taken.
Get this away from me.
He’s your son.
Son?
He’s not a man any more.
He’s your son.
He’s my brother.
He’s a Greyjoy.
Watch yourself.
I’ve made my decision.
And I’ve made mine.
I’m going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet.
I’m going to choose the best killers on the Iron Islands.
Get those ropes!
I’m going to sail up the Narrow Sea, all the way to the Weeping Water.
I’m going to march on the Dreadfort.
I’m going to find my little brother, and I’m going to bring him home.
What is it?
Dragonglass.
We found them at the Fist.
Someone buried them a long time ago.
Someone wanted us to find them.
Why?
What are they for?
Killing White Walkers.
How do you know that?
The Walker came for my baby.
And Sam…
But no one’s killed a White Walker in thousands of years.
Well, I suppose someone had to be the first.
Take it, Hodor.
And the archer.
I got lucky with one of them.
There are more.
Many more.
And for every one of them, the dead men, more than you could count.
I wish you’d come with us.
I wish I could.
I really do.
How are you keeping?
Great.
Never better.
It was just a bit of blood.
I should have known.
Every time a highborn asks my name, it’s trouble.
We’re not really people to you.
Just ways to get what you want.
I’m not a highborn.
She called you “Ser.
” I heard it.
A recent state of affairs.
I was born in Flea Bottom, just like you.
Sure, you were.
You’re my friend.
You’re here to help.
I lived below the Street of Flour.
How far below?
How close to the Red Keep were you?
The shit that poured from their privy pipes flowed down the side of Aegon’s Hill, along Tanner’s Row and right in front of my front door on Gin Alley.
Gin Alley.
The Street of Steel, with your armour and your knights?
You lived in the fancy part of town.
And here we are now.
Two boys from Flea Bottom in the castle of a king.
Yeah, we’ve come a long way.
We’re all the same, really.
She went to great pains to point that out to me.
If you mistrust fancy people so much, why were you in such a hurry to trust her?
You’re me.
Never been with a woman.
Never talked to a woman, really.
And then she comes at you, big words, no clothes.
What would you have done?
She does know her way around a man’s head, I’ll give her that.
So how’d you become a lord?
Oh.
That’s a long story.
Better not, then.
I’m a bit busy.
Many years ago I helped King Stannis out of a difficult situation.
He rewarded me with a lordship.
And this.
You see?
Highborns.
I didn’t want to be a lord.
I nearly didn’t accept.
Why did you?
I did it for my son.
I didn’t want him to step over a river of shit every time he stepped through his front door.
I wanted him to have a better life.
Does he?
He’s dead.
How’d he die?
Following me.
When did you come to this strange country?
When I was .
You were only a child.
I stopped being a child when I was nine.
My mother made sure of that.
You’ve been a good influence on our mutual friend, you know.
He used to drink from sundown to sunup, visit three brothels a night, gamble away his father’s money.
Now it’s just the drinking.
And now I’m his wife’s servant.
I brush her hair and clip her nails and empty her chamber pot.
She is a sweet young thing.
None of this is her fault.
I love that girl.
I would kill for her.
Do you think that makes it easier for me?
No, I expect not.
She’s young and she’s beautiful and highborn.
We break bread with them, but that doesn’t make us family.
We’ve learned their language, but we’ll never be their countrymen.
If you let yourself believe that a foreign girl with no name could spend her life with the son of Tywin Lannister…
I have a name.
You have one name.
As do I.
Here, only the family name matters.
What do you want from me, Lord Varys?
Diamonds.
I’d tell you to beware carrying so much wealth, but you know how to protect yourself.
Get on one of those ships.
Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr.
You can buy a house with these diamonds, a very large house.
Hire servants.
Start a new life, a good life, far from here.
The mysterious foreign beauty.
You’ll have suitors lining up.
Why do you want me to leave?
Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive who could make this country a better place.
He has the mind, the will, and the right last name.
And you, you are a complication.
I know you love him.
And I know it’s true love, not bought by gold and silver.
I’m not asking you to leave him for money.
I’m asking you to leave because your presence in the capital endangers him.
This will never be your home, my lady.
Find a true home somewhere far from here, while there’s still time.
Lord Varys.
If he wants me to leave, he can tell me himself.
Keep up.
I don’t think I can, my lord.
It’s not easy being drunk all the time.
Everyone would do it, if it were easy.
Leave.
So, enjoying married life?
An unhappy wife is a wine merchant’s best friend.
She doesn’t deserve this.
Deserve?
Be careful with that.
Start trying to work out who deserves what, and before long you’ll spend your days weeping for every person in the world.
There’s nothing worse than a lateblooming philosopher.
Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit?
I won’t be marrying Ser Loras.
I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage.
You’re not me.
You want to make things better for Sansa?
Give her a child.
So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it?
So she can have some happiness in her life.
You have children.
How happy would you say you are?
Not very.
But if it weren’t for my children, I’d have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep.
They’re the reason I’m alive.
Even Joffrey?
Even Joffrey.
He was all I had once.
Before Myrcella was born.
I used to spend hours looking at him.
His wisps of hair.
His tiny little hands and feet.
He was such a jolly little fellow.
You always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies.
“We should have known.
Even then we should have known.
” It’s nonsense.
Whenever he was with me, he was happy.
And no one can take that away from me, not even Joffrey, how it feels to have someone.
Someone of your own.
How long does it go on?
Until we’ve dealt with all our enemies.
Every time we deal with an enemy, we create two more.
Then I suppose it will go on for quite a long time.
I’m telling you, that’s what she did.
Sounded like a cow in heat.
Aye, not for long.
That’s right.
Black Walder shut her up right quick.
None of the Starks had much to say about the end of that meal.
I’ll tell you what, though.
The hardest thing was getting that wolf’s head to stay on the body.
You sewed it on?
I did.
I bet there were , men claiming they were the one.
It was me.
And Malcolm and Talbott.
Well, the thing was so heavy, it fell off the first time.
Took the skin right with it.
What we ended up having to do was hook the needle right under the collarbone, give it a nice firm mooring and…
What do you want?
Mind if I keep warm?
Fuck off.
But I’m hungry.
Does “fuck off” mean something different where you’re from?
I’ve got money.
What kind of coin is that?
It’s worth a lot.
Sorry.
Little shit.
Fool!
Where did you get the knife?
From you.
Is that the first man you’ve killed?
The first man.
Next time you’re going to do something like that, tell me first.
Valar Morghulis.
Ygritte, you know I didn’t have a choice.
You always knew who I was, what I am.
I have to go home now.
I know you won’t hurt me.
You know nothing, Jon Snow.
I do know some things.
I know I love you.
I know you love me.
But I have to go home now.
I know how this must look.
What I meant was…
I swear to you, my lord…
I’m not a lord, my dear.
Not for many, many years.
Every man who joins the Night’s Watch renounces all former titles.
Among other things.
What is your name?
Gilly.
Ah.
For the gillyflower.
Lovely.
Yes, my…
Maester.
Master.
Maester.
And the child?
She hasn’t chosen a name yet.
His name is Sam.
Tarly, do you remember the oath you swore when you joined this order?
He’s not my child, Maester Aemon.
She’s one of Craster’s wives.
I remember every word of the oath.
“Night gathers and my watch begins.
“I am the shield that guards the realms of men.
“The realms of men.
” That means her as well as us.
We didn’t build miles of ice walls feet high to keep out men.
The night is gathering, Maester Aemon.
I’ve seen it.
It’s coming for all of us.
Gilly, you and your son will be our guests for the time being.
We certainly cannot send you back beyond the Wall.
Thank you…
Maester.
I can cook and clean and I can…
Good.
Samwell, fetch a quill and inkwell.
I hope your penmanship is better than your swordplay.
Miles better.
We had ravens at last count.
Make sure they’re all fed.
Every one of them flies tonight.
“To His Grace “King Stannis Baratheon.
“Invaded…
Invited “to the name day celebration “for Rylene Florent “on the first nigit…
” Night.
“First night of the full moon.
” Why is there a “G” in night?
I don’t know.
There just is.
Well, your father’s not going to go to that.
My books are better than these boring scrolls.
You could read about Balerion the Dread.
They say you can still see his skull in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep.
I’d like to see that someday.
I’ve been trying to stay out of those dungeons my whole life.
“His fangs were as long as bastard swords.
” Aye, old Balerion’s definitely better than anything your cousin Rylene’s got on offer.
But now that I’m your father’s Hand again, I have to keep him informed.
The King does not have time for this drudgery.
“To all the lords and knobble men of Westeros…
” Noblemen.
“Noblemen of Westeros, “the Night’s Watch “implores…
” What is it?
Why are they ringing the bells?
Are we being attacked?
Stay here.
Bar the door.
The usurper Robb Stark is dead.
Betrayed by his bannerman.
And you take credit because you dropped a leech into the fire?
I take no credit.
I have faith, and my faith has been rewarded.
Your Grace, the world has got so far bent.
I’ve seen things crawl out of nightmares, but my eyes were open.
I don’t know if Robb Stark died because of the Red Woman’s sorcery or because at war men die all the time, but I do know that uniting the Seven Kingdoms with blood magic is wrong.
It is evil.
And you are not an evil man.
Do you know who had this table carved and painted, Ser Davos?
Aegon Targaryen.
And do you know how Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros?
On the back of his dragon, Balerion the Dread.
He had a smaller fleet than the kings he faced and a smaller army, but he had three dragons.
Dragons are magic, Ser Davos.
My enemies have made my kingdom bleed.
I will not forget that.
I will not forgive that.
I will punish them with any arms at my disposal.
You do not need to burn the boy.
If what you say is true, a drop of his blood killed Robb Stark…
And our King is still no closer to the Iron Throne.
A great gift requires a great sacrifice.
His name is Gendry.
He’s a good lad.
A poor lad from Flea Bottom, who happens to be your nephew.
What is the life of one bastard boy against a kingdom?
Everything.
The boy must die.
What are you doing?
You’re leaving.
Is this some kind of trick?
Yes, but not on you.
Aim for that star.
Don’t stop.
There’s bread and water.
Go slow with it.
If you finish it off, no matter how thirsty you get, don’t drink seawater.
I know not to drink seawater.
Row for a full day and night and you’ll reach Rook’s Rest.
You’ll want to stop there.
Don’t.
She’ll find you.
Where should I go?
You must keep the coast on your left side until you reach King’s Landing.
The gold cloaks are looking for me.
They were looking for me for years.
Do they know your face?
No.
I’d worry more about the Red Woman.
The other way.
You ever been in a boat before?
No.
You know how to swim?
No.
Don’t fall out.
Go on.
Why are you doing this?
Because it’s right.
And because I’m a slow learner.
When you get to Flea Bottom, have a bowl of brown for me.
Horse approaching!
Halt!
Halt!
Jon!
Jon!
Jon, it’s us.
I don’t think he can see us.
Pyp?
Sam?
Hush, now.
You’re home.
Carry him inside.
Gently.
Out of the way.
Step aside, country boy.
People working here.
Cersei.
You don’t deny it?
No.
I let him go.
Your mercy saved the boy’s life.
You feel good about that?
Aye, I do.
You saved one innocent.
How many tens of thousands have you doomed?
There has got to be another way.
What other way?
Tell us about this other way.
I don’t know, Your Grace.
I can’t see the future in the fire.
Very well, Ser Davos Seaworth.
I, Stannis of the House Baratheon, First of My Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, sentence you to die.
I understand.
But since you haven’t yet unnamed me Hand of the King, it is my duty to advise you against it.
You’re gonna need me.
Take him away.
Why am I gonna need you?
My King.
It’s from Maester Aemon of the Night’s Watch.
Their Lord Commander is dead.
Took a ranging party north and never made it back.
One lad did, though.
What he saw beyond the Wall, it’s coming for all of us.
When did you learn to read?
Matthos taught me before he died, so I could be of better service to you.
This War of Five Kings means nothing.
The true war lies to the north, my King.
Death marches on the Wall.
Only you can stop him.
You can’t stop him alone.
You need someone to rebuild your army for you, someone to convince this lord and that lord to fight for you, to bring sellswords and pirates to your side.
I’ve made my decision.
He’s right.
You need him.
He has a part to play in the war to come.
You see, Ser Davos?
You’ve been saved by that fire god you like to mock.
You’re in His army now.
They will come, Your Grace.
When they’re ready.
Perhaps they didn’t want to be conquered.
You didn’t conquer them.
You liberated them.
People learn to love their chains.
This is Daenerys Targaryen, the Stormborn, the Unburnt, the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, the Mother of Dragons.
It is to her you owe your freedom.
No.
You do not owe me your freedom.
I cannot give it to you.
Your freedom is not mine to give.
It belongs to you and you alone.
If you want it back, you must take it for yourselves.
Each and every one of you.

Magnificent.
Mmmhmm.
Looks freshforged.
It is.
No one’s made a Valyrian steel sword since the Doom of Valyria.
There are three living smiths who know how to rework Valyrian steel.
The finest of them was in Volantis.
Came here to King’s Landing at my invitation.
Where did you get this much Valyrian steel?
From someone who no longer had need of it.
You’ve wanted one in the family for a long time.
And now we have two.
Two?
The original weapon was absurdly large.
Plenty of steel for two swords.
Well, thank you.
It’s glorious.
You’ll have to train your left hand.
Any decent swordsman knows how to use both hands.
You’ll never be as good.
No.
But as long as I’m better than everyone else, it doesn’t matter.
You can’t serve in the Kingsguard with one hand.
Where’s that written?
I can and I will.
The Kingsguard oath is for life.
The war is over.
The King is safe.
The King is never safe.
How many people in this city alone would love to see his head on a pike?
Other knights protected the King while you were a prisoner.
They will continue to do so when you go home.
Home?
You’ll return to Casterly Rock and rule in my stead.
You are the Lord of Casterly Rock.
I am the King’s Hand.
My place is here.
I don’t expect to see the Rock again before I die.
You know what they call me?
Kingslayer.
Oathbreaker.
Man without honour.
Now you want me to break another sacred vow.
You won’t be breaking anything.
There is a precedent to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties.
The King will exercise that prerogative.
No.
No?
No.
I don’t believe I asked you a question.
There’s my answer.
If you think your bloody honour comes before your…
My bloody honour is beyond repair, but my answer is still no.
I don’t want Casterly Rock, a wife, children.
What do you want?
Supper would be nice.
For years I’ve tried to teach you.
If you haven’t learned by now, you never will.
Go.
If serving as a glorified bodyguard is the sum of your ambition, go serve.
I suppose you want the sword back.
Keep it.
A onehanded man with no family needs all the help he can get.
How many Dornishmen does it take to fuck a goat?
Please don’t.
Seems to me the smart place to meet travellers is in a tavern.
That way, one party is late, the other party can drink some ale inside.
This is the Prince of Dorne we’re waiting for, not one of your sellsword friends.
If he’s so damned important, how come they sent you to meet him?
There’s bad blood between the Martells of Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock.
Has been for years.
And just in case the Martells of Dorne are looking to spill some Lannister blood, it may as well be yours, eh?
No need for cynicism.
I happen to be an accomplished diplomat.
Oh.
Ah, here we are.
Can you read the sigils?
Yellow balls?
Wild lemons on a purple field, House Dalt of Lemonwood.
A vulture grasping a baby in its talons, House of Blackmont.
A crowned skull, the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave.
Boy knows his Dornish houses.
I need a sigil.
And House Martell, a red sun pierced by a spear?
I don’t see it, my lord.
Well met, my lords.
His Grace King Joffrey welcomes you in his name.
My lord father, the King’s Hand, sends his greetings as well.
I am Tyrion Lannister of Casterly Rock, Master of Coin.
Forgive me.
I don’t see Prince Doran in your company.
The prince’s health forces him to remain at Sunspear.
He sends his brother, Prince Oberyn, to attend the royal wedding.
The King will be delighted to enjoy the company of a warrior as renowned as Prince Oberyn.
Will he?
Where is Prince Oberyn?
Arrived before dawn.
Not a man for welcome parties.
Very well.
My lords, these fine men from the City Watch will escort you to your quarters in the Red Keep.
You must be weary after such a long journey.
Some accomplished diplomacy that was.
Now where?
We must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody, or several somebodies.
How do you plan on finding a single Dornishman in a city this big?
You’re famous for fucking half of Westeros.
You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad road.
Where would you go?
I’d probably go to sleep, but I’m getting old.
Look at this one.
How lovely is she?
Beautiful.
But pale.
We like them pale in the capital.
Shows they don’t work the fields.
Do I frighten you?
You like?
Timid bores me.
Hmm.
You’re a bit of mischief, aren’t you?
I think she likes you.
She has good taste.
You’re not timid, are you?
Not timid.
Do you like women?
When they look like her, my lord.
This one will do nicely.
Very good, my lady.
Oh, I’m not a lady.
A term of courtesy in this establishment.
A lie anywhere.
Why not use the right words?
I’m a bastard.
She is a whore.
And you’re what?
A procurer.
Any of the others?
The two girls can leave.
You stay.
I’m afraid I’m not on offer, my lord.
Everyone who works for Littlefinger is on offer.
Take off your clothes.
We’ll be here a while.
My lord.
I am a prince, boy.
Have you ever been with a prince?
Can’t say I have.
I’m wildly expensive.
Take off your clothes.
Which way do you like it?
My way.
And so he spoke, and so he spoke That Lord of Castamere But now the rains…
Oberyn.
Weep o’er his hall…
Oberyn, don’t.
With no one there to hear Yes now the rains weep o’er his hall And not a soul to hear You lost, friend?
Forgive me for staring.
I don’t see many Lannisters where I’m from.
I don’t see many Dornishmen in the capital.
We don’t like the smell.
Come with me, lover.
Gods, look at this one.
Sirs, if you follow me, I’ll arrange for a private room.
Why are you wasting a woman like this on a Dornishman?
Bring him a shaved goat and a bottle of olive oil.
Hmm.
Do you know why all the world hates a Lannister?
You think your gold and your lions and your gold lions make you better than everyone.
May I tell you a secret?
You’re not a golden lion.
You’re just a pink little man who is far too slow on the draw.
Longsword is a bad option in close quarters.
When I pull my blade, your friend starts bleeding.
Quite a lot, I’m afraid.
So many veins in the wrist.
He’ll live if you get him help straightaway.
So, decisions.
Prince Oberyn, forgive the intrusion.
We heard there might be…
…
trouble.
Apologies, my love.
I’m here to welcome you to the capital.
Ellaria Sand, my paramour.
The King’s own Uncle Imp.
Tyrion, son of Tywin Lannister.
If there’s anything I can do to make your stay at King’s Landing…
What are you?
His hired killer?
It started that way, aye.
Now I’m a knight.
How did that come to pass?
Killed the right people.
We’ll need a few more girls.
Girls, yes?
You don’t partake?
Oh, I partook.
Now I’m married.
Prince Oberyn, a word in private?
Seems I visited the Lannister brothel by mistake.
Oh, they take all kinds.
Even Dornishmen.
The King is very grateful that you travelled all this way for his wedding.
Let us speak truth here.
Joffrey is insulted.
I am only the second son.
Well, speaking as a fellow second son, I have grown rather used to being the family insult.
Why did you come to King’s Landing?
I was invited to the royal wedding.
I thought we were speaking truth.
The last time I was in the capital was many years ago.
Another wedding.
My sister Elia and Rhaegar Targaryen, the Last Dragon.
My sister loved him.
She bore his children.
Swaddled them, rocked them, fed them at her own breast.
Elia wouldn’t let the wet nurse touch them.
And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen left her for another woman.
That started a war, and the war ended right here, when your father’s army took the city.
I wasn’t actually present.
They butchered those children.
My nephew and niece.
Carved them up and wrapped them in Lannister cloaks.
And my sister, you know what they did to her?
I’m asking you a question.
I’ve heard rumours.
Hmm.
So have I.
The one I keep hearing is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain raped Elia and split her in half with his great sword.
I wasn’t there.
I don’t know what happened.
If the Mountain killed my sister, your father gave the order.
Tell your father I’m here.
And tell him the Lannisters aren’t the only ones who pay their debts.
They’re dragons, Khaleesi.
They can never be tamed.
Not even by their mother.
Ser Barristan.
Your Grace.
Where’s Daario Naharis?
Where’s Grey Worm?
Gambling, Your Grace.
Gambling?
Mhysa.
Mhysa.
How long have they been at it?
Since midnight, Your Grace.
Ser Worm is stronger than he looks.
But I can see his arms beginning to shake.
What’s the prize to winning this stupid contest?
The honour of riding by your side on the road to Meereen.
That honour goes to Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan, as neither of them kept me waiting this morning.
You two will ride in the rear guard and protect the livestock.
The last man holding his sword can find a new queen to fight for.
You like this girl?
Must be frustrating.
You are not a smart man, Daario Naharis.
I’d rather have no brains and two balls.
You need to eat something.
Pigeon pie.
No, thank you.
Lemon cakes?
No, thank you.
You love lemon cakes.
Tell her she needs to eat.
My lady, you do need to eat.
I don’t want to eat.
If I could have a moment alone with my wife.
She needs to eat.
I can’t let you starve.
I swore to protect you.
My lady, I am your husband.
Let me help you.
How can you help me?
I don’t know, but I can try.
I lie awake all night staring at the canopy, thinking about how they died.
I could get you essence of nightshade to help you sleep.
Do you know what they did to my brother?
How they sewed his direwolf’s head onto his body?
And my mother.
They cut her throat to the bone and threw her body in the river.
What happened to your family was a terrible crime.
I didn’t know your brother.
He seemed like a good man, but I didn’t know him.
Your mother, I admired her.
She wanted to have me executed, but I admired her.
She was a strong woman.
And she was fierce when it came to protecting her children.
Sansa.
Your mother would want you to carry on.
You know it’s true.
Will you pardon me, my lord?
I’d like to visit the godswood.
Of course.
Prayer can be helpful, I hear.
I don’t pray any more.
It’s the only place I can go where people don’t talk to me.
My lion.
What are you doing?
What does it look like?
Come here.
How many times have I told you?
You can’t visit me here.
I know.
We have come to a dangerous place.
Have you forgotten me?
Do you know how long it’s been?
Of course I haven’t forgotten.
I want you.
Don’t you want me?
Things are a bit tense right now.
What things?
My nephew the King wants to murder me.
My wife hates me because my father murdered her family.
Oberyn Martell wants to murder everyone whose last name is Lannister.
You need to relax.
Don’t you want to relax?
What’s wrong?
I told you.
It’s not a good time.
It’s never a good time.
You have your child bride now.
Shae.
Do you love her?
Love her?
I barely know her.
She’s a child.
She despises me.
That’s not an answer.
I don’t love her.
You tried to ship me away.
Ship you away?
Give me diamonds and make me disappear.
What are you talking about?
If you want me to leave, just say it.
Say it!
Shh.
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
You want me to stay?
A work of art.
The craftsmanship is excellent.
You like it so much, you’re welcome to chop off your own hand and take it.
You’re such an ingrate.
I spent days with the goldsmith getting the details just right.
Days?
Better part of an afternoon.
There, how does that feel?
Uh…
A hook would be more practical.
Elegant, I think.
CERSEl Thank you for your help with the other matter.
The symptoms have abated?
Gone completely.
I am in your debt, Maester Qyburn.
Not a maester, Your Grace, but happy to help whenever I can.
Odd little man.
I’ve grown fond of him.
He’s quite talented.
What symptoms?
Symptoms that are not your concern.
You let him touch you?
You jealous?
I’m surprised.
You never let Pycelle near you.
You think I’d let that old lecher put his hands on me?
He smells like a dead cat.
I’m not sure I’ve ever smelled a dead cat.
Well, they smell like Pycelle.
You drink more than you used to.
Yes.
Why?
Hmm.
Let’s see.
You started a brawl in the streets with Ned Stark and disappeared from the capital.
My husband died in a tragic hunting accident.
It must have been traumatic for you.
My only daughter was shipped off to Dorne.
We suffered through a siege.
A rather short siege.
That I didn’t expect to survive.
And now I’m marrying my eldest son to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden, while I’m supposed to marry her brother, a renowned pillowbiter.
So…
Father disowned me today.
He can’t disown you.
You’re all he’s got.
You’re forgetting Tyrion.
You don’t really plan on staying in the Kingsguard, do you?
Staying in the Kingsguard means I live right here in the Red Keep with you.
Not now.
I want…
Not now?
When?
I’ve been back for weeks.
Something’s changed.
Everything’s changed.
You come back after all this time with no apologies and one hand and expect everything to be the same?
What do you want me to apologise for?
For leaving me.
You think I wanted to be taken prisoner?
Don’t know what you wanted.
You weren’t here.
You left me alone.
Every day I was a prisoner, I plotted my escape.
Every day.
I murdered people so I could be here with you.
You took too long.
I…
What are you saying?
You took too long.
Come in.
Go away.
Forgive me, Your Grace.
You told me to come at once if there was anything important.
You plan on killing all the crows yourself?
Do you plan on sitting here, scratching your balls till winter?
We wait for Mance’s orders.
You sent a man over the Wall at the full moon.
If he’s not back yet, he’s not coming back.
And what is it you want?
March on Castle Black with just this lot?
Your pretty crow said a thousand men are nesting there.
He’s a liar.
He is?
Shouldn’t it be “he was”?
You said you put three arrows in him.
I did.
I’ve seen you slip a shaft through a rabbit’s eye at yards.
If that boy’s still walking, it’s ’cause you let him go.
Thenns.
I fucking hate Thenns.
Mance sent you?
How did you find us?
You came from the south, not the north.
Took a detour.
Got some supper from a village down that way.
Why does the meat down here taste so much better than it does on our side of the Wall?
Help yourself.
Maybe everything’s just better fed down here.
Fat and lazy.
Easier for us.
You didn’t see us coming?
Lost your warg?
And that baby crow you had with you, lost him, too?
I’ll answer to Mance.
I won’t answer to you.
She yours?
I’m not anybody’s.
Too scrawny.
Not like those crows at Castle Black.
Think of them stuck in their larders, stuffing their faces with ham and blood sausage and stew, getting nice and fat and marbled.
I know we’ve had our differences, Tormund, but just one time before you die, you really ought to try crow.
Draw.
Loose.
Last time I saw him, he was in the courtyard at Winterfell.
He said, “Next time I see you, you’ll be all in black.
” I was jealous of Robb my whole life.
The way my father looked at him, I wanted that.
He was better than me at everything.
Fighting and hunting and riding and girls.
Gods, the girls loved him.
I wanted to hate him, but I never could.
Sometimes I want to hate you.
You’re better than me at everything.
Except reading.
They’re, um…
They’re ready for you.
He’s wanted to hang me for a while.
Now’s his chance.
No one’s going to hang you.
You’ve done nothing wrong.
I’ve done plenty wrong.
So you admit you murdered Qhorin Halfhand?
I didn’t murder him.
No?
You put your sword through a brother of the Night’s Watch.
What do you call that?
He wanted me to kill him.
A bastard son of a traitor.
What would you expect?
The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.
Don’t talk about the Halfhand as if you knew him.
He was my brother.
Then you’d know he’d do anything to defend the Wall.
The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him…
The free folk?
Listen to him.
He even talks like a wildling now.
Aye, I talk like a wildling.
I ate with the wildlings.
I climbed the Wall with the wildlings.
I…
I laid with a wildling girl.
You admit to breaking your vows, then?
I do.
The law is the law.
The boy must die.
If we beheaded every ranger who lay with a girl, the Wall would be manned by headless men.
There’s a difference between sneaking off to the Mole’s Town brothel and sleeping with the enemy.
While we sit here debating which rules I broke, Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of ,.
Impossible.
You can’t get wildlings together before they start killing each other.
,.
He’s united the Thenns, the Hornfoots, the iceriver clans.
He has giants fighting for him.
Giants?
Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?
I commanded the City Watch of King’s Landing, boy.
And now you’re here.
You must not have been very good at your job.
How dare you?
There’s a band of wildlings south of the Wall already, led by Tormund Giantsbane.
I killed their warg and three others.
They shot me full of arrows.
Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north.
The signal for the attack will be a bonfire.
Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen.
That’s the truth.
All the truth.
Do you intend to execute me, or am I free to go?
None of us are free.
We are men of the Night’s Watch.
But we won’t be taking your head today, Jon Snow.
Go on.
I am acting commander here, Maester Aemon.
Yes, you are.
And I don’t trust the bastard.
He told the truth.
And you always know when a man’s telling a lie?
How did you acquire this magical power?
I grew up in King’s Landing.
No.
You’re a queen, not an ox.
Your grandfather gave me a necklace just like this one for my st nameday.
The wedding is in a fortnight, Grandmother.
You can’t say no to everything.
Nonsense.
My little dears, go and speak to the jewellers of King’s Landing.
Tell them who you are, who sent you.
The one who brings me the best necklace will get to keep the next best.
The Margaery Tyrell who walks into the Sept a fortnight from now will inspire a thousand songs.
How sad it will be if she’s wearing rubbish like that.
Perhaps I should just let Joffrey choose it for me.
End up with a string of dead sparrow heads around my neck.
You watch that.
Even here, with me.
My word.
My lady.
Please pardon me for interrupting.
My name is Brienne of Tarth.
We know who you are.
We’ve heard all about you.
But hearing is one thing.
Aren’t you just marvellous!
Absolutely singular.
I hear you knocked my grandson into the dirt, like the silly little boy he is.
My lady, I know this is a very busy time for you, but if I could just have a moment.
You dare not refuse.
A shadow?
With the face of Stannis Baratheon.
I swear to you by all the gods it was Stannis.
He plunged his sword through Renly’s heart and disappeared.
One day, I will avenge our king.
Joffrey is our king now.
I meant no offence.
And you’ve given none.
All the Kingsguard will be on duty.
Ser Boros will be stationed here.
Ser Preston will be stationed here, beside the primary entertainment.
Your Grace?
Huh?
One guard at the thing.
Go on.
Ser Meryn will guard Lady Margaery and Tommen.
I’ve always guarded the King himself, my lord.
Ever since your absence.
And I thank you for it, Ser Meryn.
All very good.
I don’t expect any trouble.
The people love their King.
They know who keeps them fed.
Margaery Tyrell, I’ve heard.
By my leave.
They know I saved the city.
I won the war.
The war’s not won.
Not while Stannis lives.
I broke Stannis on the Blackwater.
Pity you weren’t there to help, Uncle.
My apologies, Your Grace.
I was rather busy.
Busy getting captured.
So this is the famous Book of Brothers?
All the great deeds of all the great Kingsguard.
Ser Arthur Dayne.
The Sword of the Morning.
Led the attack on the Kingswood Brotherhood.
Defeated the Smiling Knight in single combat.
Ser Duncan the Tall.
Four pages.
He must have been quite a man.
So they say.
Ser Jaime Lannister.
Hmm.
Someone forgot to write down all your great deeds.
There’s still time.
Is there?
For a yearold knight with one hand?
How can you protect me with that?
I use my left hand now, Your Grace.
Makes for more of a contest.
Have you ever been to Meereen?
Several times, Your Grace, with Master Kraznys.
And?
They say a thousand slaves died building the Great Pyramid of Meereen.
And now an army of former slaves is marching to her gates.
You think the Great Masters are worried?
If they’re smart, Your Grace.
You were told to ride at the back of the train.
Yes, My Queen.
But I need to speak to you about something important.
A matter of strategy.
Your Grace.
All right, what is this matter of strategy?
A dusk rose.
Would you like to walk at the back of the train instead of riding?
And this one’s called lady’s lace.
Would you like to walk without shoes?
You have to know a land to rule it.
Its plants, its rivers, its roads, its people.
Dusk rose tea eases fever.
Everyone in Meereen knows that.
Especially the slaves who have to make the tea.
If you want them to follow you, you have to become a part of their world.
Strategy.
Harpy’s Gold.
No tea from this one.
Beautiful but poisonous.
You are a gambler, aren’t you?
Your Grace.
There’s one on every mile marker between here and Meereen.
How many miles are there?
, Your Grace.
I’ll tell our men to ride ahead and bury them.
You don’t need to see this.
You will do no such thing.
I will see each and every one of their faces.
Remove her collar before you bury her.
There she is.
Yes.
And?
You made a promise.
To return the Stark girls to their mother, who is now dead.
To keep them safe.
Arya Stark hasn’t been seen since her father was killed.
Where do you think she is?
My money’s on dead.
There’s a certain safety in death, wouldn’t you say?
And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister.
Bit of a complication.
A complication does not release you from a vow.
What do you want me to do?
Kidnap my sisterinlaw?
And take her where?
Where would she be safer than here?
Look me in the eye and tell me that you think she’ll be safe in King’s Landing.
Are you sure we’re not related?
Ever since I’ve returned, every Lannister I’ve seen has been a miserable pain in my ass.
Maybe you’re a Lannister, too.
You’ve got the hair for it, if not the looks.
It’s all right.
You’re drunk.
Yes.
I have good reason to be.
Once I was a knight.
Now I’m only a fool.
Don’t you know me?
Ser Dontos.
The King’s nameday celebration.
I’m sorry.
I should have remembered.
I can’t accept your apology.
I may be a fool, but I’m a living fool, thanks to you.
Anyone would have done the same.
But only you did.
I can never repay you.
You gave me my life.
But this is worth more than my life.
It belonged to my mother, and her mother before her.
House Hollard was strong once.
House on the rise.
That’s all that’s left of those days, thanks to a few sad, fat drunks like me.
I can’t take it.
It’s very kind of you, but I can’t.
I don’t have anything else left.
That’s all.
Take it.
Wear it.
Let my name have one more moment in the sun before it disappears from the world.
I’ll wear it with pride, Ser Dontos.
Yeah.
When am I going to get a horse of my own?
The little lady wants a pony.
The little lady wants away from your stench.
Horses aren’t easy to come by.
Even if they were, you think I’m gonna put you on your own horse?
Watch the only thing of value I’ve got in the world ride away?
Why don’t you have any money?
Didn’t you steal anything from Joffrey before you left?
No.
You’re not very smart, are you?
I’m not a thief.
You’re fine with murdering little boys, but thieving is beneath you?
A man’s got to have a code.
You think I’m gonna escape?
Where would I go?
I’d be dead by nightfall without you.
My family’s gone.
I’ve got no one.
You’ve got an aunt in the Vale.
Your rich Aunt Lysa.
After I sell you to her, maybe she’ll have enough left over to buy you that pony you want so much.
I’m hungry.
You’re hungry.
Five horses, five men.
More than I feel like killing on an empty stomach.
I know him.
The small one.
His name is Polliver.
He captured us and took us to Harrenhal.
He killed Lommy.
What the fuck’s a Lommy?
He was my friend.
Polliver stole my sword and put it right through his neck.
He’s still got it.
Got what?
My sword Needle.
Needle?
Of course you named your sword.
Lots of people name their swords.
Lots of cunts.
What are you…
Get back…
My brother gave me that sword.
Get back here.
He killed my friend.
I don’t care if he ate your friend.
We’re not going in there.
Come on, give it up.
Come here.
Let’s have a feel, eh?
Leave it.
Come here.
Please, she’s a good girl.
Shut your mouth and pour us more ale, and we may not take her with us when we’re done with her.
I know you.
You’re the Hound.
Pour our new friend some ale.
What brings you so far north?
I could ask the same of you.
What are you doing up here?
Just keeping the King’s peace.
No need.
The war’s over.
So I’ve heard.
Stannis defeated at the Blackwater.
Robb Stark killed at the Twins.
And where am I for all of it?
Stuck with your brother.
Meaning no offence.
None taken.
He’s good, the Mountain is.
Best at what he does.
But torture, torture.
You spend enough time putting the hammer to people, you start to feel like a carpenter making chairs.
Drains the fun right out of it.
And what’s life without a little fun?
But I don’t need to tell you that, eh?
She’s all right.
I’ve had better.
You know what?
You should come with us.
His kind, they’ve always got something hidden away somewhere.
Gold, silver, more daughters.
Always something if you know how to make them talk.
And there’s plenty of him between here and King’s Landing.
You could do well for yourself.
We certainly have been.
I’m not going to King’s Landing.
Think about it.
We could do whatever we like, wherever we go.
These are the King’s colours.
No one’s standing in his way now.
Which means no one’s standing in ours.
Fuck the King.
When I heard that Joffrey’s dog had tucked tail and run from the Battle of the Blackwater, I didn’t believe it.
But here you are.
Here I am.
Bring me one of those chickens.
You got money to pay for it?
You paid for it?
No.
But we’re the King’s men.
So, you got money?
Not a penny.
I’ll still take that chicken.
Tell you what.
We’ll trade you.
One of our little chickens for one of yours.
Give us a go at your friend.
Lowell there likes them a bit broken in.
You’re a talker.
Listening makes me thirsty.
And hungry.
Think I’ll take two chickens.
You don’t understand the situation.
I understand that if any more words come pouring out your cunt mouth, I’m gonna have to eat every fucking chicken in this room.
You lived your life for the King.
You’re gonna die for some chickens?
Someone is.
Something wrong with your leg, boy?
What do you mean?
Can you walk?
I’ve got to carry you?
Carry me?
Fine little blade.
Maybe I’ll pick my teeth with it.To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)

Well done.
You, too.
I only wounded her.
You brought her down.
That’s what matters.
A fine shot.
Wasn’t it, Reek?
A fine shot, master.
My lady.
Please, my lord.
It hurts.
Please.
Sweet.
Don’t cry.
It will be over soon.
She thinks she’s pretty.
Let me put one through her face.
We have to reward the hounds, love.
They did all the hard work.
Why?
I did whatever you asked.
But you made Myranda feel jealous.
Me, jealous of her?
My lord, please.
You can see that your presence has become a bit of a problem.
Rip her!
Rip her!
Not so pretty now.
Your new hand, it’s nicer than the old one.
Wouldn’t you agree, Pod?
Is it solid gold?
Gilded steel.
You’re not eating.
Why is no one eating?
My wife wastes away and my brother starves himself.
I’m not hungry.
You lost a hand, not a stomach.
Try the boar.
Cersei can’t get enough of it since one killed Robert for her.
A toast.
To the proud Lannister children.
The dwarf, the cripple, and the mother of madness.
I’ll clean it up.
No, I’ll do it.
Leave us.
It’s only wine.
I can’t fight any more.
What about your left?
I can hold a sword, but all my instincts are wrong.
How can I protect the King when I can hardly wipe my own ass?
You’re the Lord Commander now.
Command.
Let others do the fighting.
When was the last time Father used a sword?
I’m not Father.
I’m the Kingslayer.
When people find out I can’t slay a pigeon…
Train, then.
Learn to fight with your other hand.
With whom?
You?
Men talk.
As soon as someone discovers I can’t fight, he’ll tell everyone.
You need a proper, discreet swordsman.
I have just the one.
My brother tells me you can keep your mouth shut.
Unusual talent for a sellsword.
He tells me you shit gold, just like your father.
Is this place safe?
There’s this knight, Leygood.
Got thunderbolts on his shield.
Uhhuh.
Right here is where I fuck his wife.
She’s a screamer, that one.
If they don’t hear her, they won’t hear us.
I’ve never seen Valyrian steel before.
She’s a beauty.
Problem is, if you fight with an edged blade, I’ll have to.
And if I fight with an edged blade, I’ll have no one left to pay me.
I haven’t used a sparring sword since I was nine.
Mmmmmm.
Bold warrior you are, attacking a man when his guard’s down.
Best time to attack a man.
Mind yourself.
lf I still had my right hand…
Plan on growing it back?
Come on, then.
Open the gates!
Riders coming in!
Let’s get these horses seen to!
Father.
Welcome home.
Walda, this is Ramsay Snow, my bastard.
A pleasure, Mother.
Hello.
See that the horses are fed, watered, and rubbed down.
And take Lady Walda to her chambers.
This way, my lady.
Where is your prize?
With the hounds.
I’ll have a look at him.
I hear you took a hand from the Kingslayer.
Word travels.
How he screamed.
You would have loved it.
Father.
What did you do to him?
I trained him.
He was a slow learner, but he learned.
You flayed him.
Peeled a few bits.
Removed a few others.
This was Balon Greyjoy’s son and heir.
We’ve been flaying our enemies for , years.
The flayed man is on our banners.
My banners, not yours.
You’re not a Bolton.
You’re a Snow.
Tywin Lannister has given me the North.
But he won’t lift a finger to help me take it.
As long as the ironborn hold Moat Cailin, our armies are trapped south of the Neck.
Theon was a valuable hostage, not your plaything.
I wanted to trade him for Moat Cailin.
I already asked.
Lord Greyjoy refused.
Savages have no…
You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy without my consent?
You made me acting Lord of the Dreadfort.
I acted.
I had to smuggle myself into my own lands, thanks to the Greyjoys.
I needed Theon whole.
Theon was our enemy.
But Reek will never betray us.
I placed far too much trust in you.
Reek, how could you let me stand before my father unshaven?
It’s disrespectful.
Sorry, my lord.
Give him the razor.
I’m not a Bolton, Father.
What does it matter?
Go on, Reek.
A nice close shave.
Reek, tell Father, where are Bran and Rickon Stark?
I don’t know, my lord.
You murdered them and displayed their corpses at Winterfell.
Reek, did you murder the Stark boys?
No, my lord.
Just two farm boys.
And crisped them so no one would know?
Yes, my lord.
The Starks have always ruled the North.
If Bran and Rickon are alive, the country will rally to their side, now that Robb Stark is gone.
Oh, that’s right, Reek.
Robb Stark is dead.
Sorry.
I know he was like a brother to you.
But my father put a knife through his heart.
How do you feel about that?
You ready for a hunt?
Always.
Find those boys and I’ll give you , acres and a holdfast.
Your pet rat have any thoughts on which way they went after Winterfell?
Jon Snow is at Castle Black.
Who the fuck is Jon Snow?
Their bastard brother.
He could be sheltering them.
He may know where they are.
Even if he doesn’t, he’s half Stark himself.
Could be a threat.
You want to prove yourself a Bolton?
Gather whatever men you can and ride for Moat Cailin.
Bring this creature of yours.
Maybe he’ll be of some use.
Take the Moat for the family, for our family, and I’ll reconsider your position.
Lord Varys.
Breakfasting with the King?
I’m afraid foreigners aren’t welcome at such exclusive affairs.
Oh, to be foreign.
Shae has been noticed.
Sansa’s maid saw you with her.
She already told your sister.
It’s only a matter of time before your father hears.
So I’m guilty of being seen with my own wife’s handmaiden.
My father will ask you if there’s anything more, and you’ll tell him some clever lie.
No, I will not.
How long do you imagine your father and sister would let me live if they suspected me of lying?
I have no pet sellsword to protect me.
No legendary brother to avenge me.
Only little birds who whisper in my ear.
Forgive me if I don’t weep for you.
No one weeps for spiders, or whores.
I have friends across the sea who could help her.
She won’t leave.
I’ve told her this is a dangerous place so many times, she no longer believes it.
Your father has promised to hang the next whore he finds you with.
Have you ever known your father to make an idle threat?
From House Tyrell and the people of the Reach, Your Grace, it is my honour to present you with this wedding cup.
May you and my daughter Margaery drink deep and live long.
A handsome goblet, my lord.
Or shall I call you Father?
I should be honoured, Your Grace.
She’s the whore I told you about.
The darkhaired one.
Have her brought to the Tower of the Hand before the wedding.
Hmm.
A book?
The Lives of Four Kings.
Grand Maester Kaeth’s history of the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon, Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the Unworthy, and Daeron the Good.
A book every king should read.
Now that the war is won, we should all find time for wisdom.
Thank you, Uncle.
One of only two Valyrian steel swords in the capital, Your Grace, freshly forged in your honour.
Careful, Your Grace.
Nothing cuts like Valyrian steel.
So they say.
Such a great sword should have a name.
What shall I call her?
Stormbringer.
Terminus.
Widow’s Wail.
Wolfsbane.
Widow’s Wail.
I like that.
Every time I use it, it’ll be like cutting off Ned Stark’s head all over again.
Don’t.
You want me on the desk?
What’s wrong, my lion?
Don’t call me that.
What should I call you?
I’m afraid our friendship can’t continue.
Our friendship?
There’s a ship waiting in the harbour bound for Pentos.
What?
You’ll have your own cabin, and across the Narrow Sea a house, servants.
What is this?
I’m a married man.
My wife has suffered a great deal, as you well know.
I don’t want her to suffer any more on my account.
I need to uphold my vows.
She doesn’t want you.
I need to do right by her.
You don’t want her.
By our children.
What are you afraid of?
I’m not afraid.
You are.
You are afraid of your father and your sister.
You’re going to run from them all your life?
I need you to leave.
I’m not afraid of them.
I’m not going to run from them.
Shae.
We will fight them together.
It’s like you said, I am yours and you are mine.
You’re a whore!
Sansa is fit to bear my children, and you are not.
I can’t be in love with a whore.
I can’t have children with a whore.
How many men have you been with?
?
,?
How many whores have you been with?
I have enjoyed my time with all of them, and I have enjoyed my time with you most of all.
But now that time is over.
You’ll have a comfortable life in Pentos.
Bronn will escort you to your ship.
Hear us now.
Accept these tokens of our faith, my lord, and lead us from the darkness.
Sire, I served you well.
Lord of Light, show us the way.
Lead us from the darkness.
Selyse, you’re my sister!
Yours are the stars that guide us.
Tell him!
Tell him!
Lord of Light, protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors.
Did you see?
Their souls.
It was their souls.
Our lord took them.
Did you see?
Lord Florent was your brother by law.
He was an infidel.
He worshipped the gods of his fathers and their fathers before him.
They were the gods of your fathers, too.
I ordered him to tear down his idols.
He disobeyed.
How many ships did he bring to your cause?
How many men?
A good deal more than you.
Did you see, Ser Davos?
They’re with our lord now.
Their sins all burned away.
I’m sure they’re more than grateful, My Queen.
Meat’s off.
Our larders are almost empty.
Serve fish, then.
We’re on an island.
You hate fish.
I hate a good many things, but I suffer them all the same.
When Storm’s End was under siege and I was starving, Stannis boiled soup for me from books.
The binding glue is made from horses.
One morning, he shot two seagulls on the beach.
I’ve never tasted anything as good as grilled seagull.
Do you remember?
Of course.
Have you ever known true hunger, my lady?
That’s all I knew when I was a child.
Until you found the Lord of Light?
Until he found me.
I fear for our daughter’s soul.
Every mother should fear for her child’s soul.
She’s a stubborn little beast.
She’s a child.
You barely know her.
You think she’s sweet because she smiles when you visit.
She’s sullen and stubborn and sinful.
Why else would the Lord of Light have seen fit to mark her face?
She needs the rod.
She’s my daughter.
You will not strike her.
As you command.
Perhaps the Lady Melisandre could speak with her.
Come in.
Were you sleeping, Princess?
Did you watch the ceremony on the beach?
I heard it.
And it frightened you?
Ser Axell was my uncle.
He was always kind to me.
They’re in a better place now, Princess.
The fire cleansed them of the sins of the world.
But they screamed.
Women scream when they give birth.
Afterward they are filled with joy.
Afterward they aren’t ash and bone.
You have so many questions, don’t you?
So did I when I was a child.
I was much like you.
Only I wasn’t a princess.
And you didn’t have this.
No.
But I suffered in other ways, sweet girl, believe me.
What do you know of the gods?
I read The SevenPointed Star.
Lies and fables.
Septons speak of seven gods.
There are but two.
A god of light and love and joy, and a god of darkness, evil, and fear.
Eternally at war.
Then there are no seven heavens and no seven hells?
There’s only one hell, Princess.
The one we live in now.
Hodor.
Why did you wake me?
You’ve been gone for hours.
I was hungry.
We’re all hungry.
I was just eating.
Summer was eating.
Your body can’t live on the food your wolf consumes.
Spending too much time in Summer’s skin is dangerous.
You’re not a direwolf, Bran.
Must be glorious, though.
To run, to leap, to hunt.
To be whole.
I know it’s tempting, but if you’re trapped in Summer for too long, you’ll forget what it was to be human.
You’d forget us, Bran.
You’d forget your mother and father, your brothers and sisters, Winterfell.
You’d forget you.
And if we lose you, we lose everything.
Hodor, take me to the tree.
Look for me beneath the tree.
CERSEl He saw us!
North.
I know where we have to go.
Let it be known that Margaery of House Tyrell and Joffrey of the Houses Lannister and Baratheon are one heart, one flesh, one soul.
Cursed be he who would seek to tear them asunder.
With this kiss, I pledge my love.
We have a new queen.
Better her than you.
Bit much, wouldn’t you say?
It feels proportionate.
Proportionate to what?
The expected extravagance.
People who spend their money on this sort of nonsense tend not to have it for long.
You ought to try enjoying something before you die.
You might find it suits you.
Not now, Mace.
Lord Tywin and I are speaking.
Anyway, I don’t know what you’re complaining about.
I’m paying my share.
Shall we stick golden roses on half the meat pies to commemorate your generosity?
No, your heartfelt “Thank you” is its own reward.
I would imagine I’ll be hearing it again before long.
Wars are rather expensive.
“The Iron Bank will have its due.
” How they love to remind everyone.
Almost as much as you Lannisters with your debts.
I’m not worried about the Iron Bank.
We both know you’re smarter than that.
Come, Tywin, let us celebrate young love.
All taken care of.
You saw her board the ship?
Aye, she’s on it.
And you saw the ship sail away?
No one knows she’s there but you, me, and Varys.
How do you know?
Because if someone follows me without an invitation, I’m the last person they ever follow.
Was someone following you?
She’s gone.
I know you don’t want to believe it, but she is.
Now, go drink until it feels like you did the right thing.
Hello.
Hello.
Not you.
You look exquisite, child.
The wind has been at you, though.
I haven’t had the opportunity to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your brother.
War is war, but killing a man at a wedding, horrid.
What sort of monster would do such a thing?
As if men need more reasons to fear marriage.
My lady.
Lord Tyrion, you see?
Not as bad as all that.
Perhaps if your pauper husband were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes, he might be able to afford to bring you to Highgarden for a visit.
Now that peace has come and all is right with the world, it would do you good to see some of it.
You must excuse me.
It’s time I ate some of this food I paid for.
A coat of gold A coat of red A lion still has claws And mine are long…
Very good.
Off you go.
My love, why don’t we make the announcement?
Everyone.
The Queen would like to say a few words.
We are so fortunate to enjoy this marvellous food and drink.
Not all among us are so lucky.
To thank the gods for bringing the recent war to a just end, King Joffrey has decreed that the leftovers from our feast be given to the poorest in his city.
You’re an example to us all.
Ser Jaime, I’m very sorry.
Ser Loras, it’s quite all right.
Your sister looks very beautiful.
As does yours.
So, are you looking forward to your wedding?
Yes, very much.
Our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect.
They certainly are.
Perhaps they should get married.
If you were to marry Cersei, she’d murder you in your sleep.
If you somehow managed to put a child in her first, she’d murder him, too, long before he drew his first breath.
Luckily for you, none of this will happen because you’ll never marry her.
And neither will you.
Your Grace.
My King.
My Queen.
Lady Brienne.
So good of you to come.
I’m no lady, Your Grace.
CERSEl Did you just bow?
Apologies, Your Grace.
I never did master the curtsy.
You’re the one who put a sword through Renly Baratheon.
That’s not true, my love.
Brienne had nothing to do with it.
A shame.
I’d knight the man that put an end to that deviant’s life.
I just wanted to congratulate you both and wish you good fortune.
The country has been at war too long.
I hope your reign is long and peaceful.
Yes.
Thank you.
I hope we see more of you.
Lady Brienne.
You’re Lord Selwyn Tarth’s daughter.
That makes you a lady whether you want to be or not.
As you say, Your Grace.
I owe you my gratitude.
You returned my brother safely to King’s Landing.
In truth, he rescued me, Your Grace.
More than once.
Did he?
Haven’t heard that story before.
Not such a fascinating story.
I’m sure you have many.
Sworn to Renly Baratheon, Catelyn Stark, and now my brother.
Must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next, serving whichever lord or lady you fancy.
I don’t serve your brother, Your Grace.
But you love him.
Your Grace.
No, come to my chambers and I will examine you personally.
She’ll do no such thing.
Oh, Your Grace.
This young lady sought my advice…
You should see Qyburn.
He’s quite good.
Your Grace.
Qyburn?
Deplorable man.
Brought shame on the Citadel with his repugnant experiments.
More repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girl’s thighs?
Your Grace, I am a man of learning.
My little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him.
What do you think I could do to you?
I never meant to annoy anyone.
But you are.
You’re annoying me right now.
Every breath you draw in my presence annoys me.
So here’s what I want you to do.
Leave my presence.
Leave this wedding right now.
Go to the kitchens and instruct them that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels.
Your Grace, Queen Margaery…
The Queen is telling you the leftovers will feed the dogs, or you will.
A gold dragon to whoever knocks my fool’s hat off.
You’re in rather a good mood.
I suppose I am.
I won’t ask why.
Small pleasures.
Your Grace.
Lord Tywin.
Prince Oberyn.
I don’t believe you have met Ellaria.
This is the Lord Hand Tywin Lannister, and Cersei Lannister, the Queen Regent.
I suppose it is former Queen Regent now.
Lord Hand and Lady Cersei, Ellaria Sand.
My lord.
My lady.
Charmed.
Can’t say I’ve ever met a Sand before.
We are everywhere in Dorne.
I have , brothers and sisters.
Bastards are born of passion, aren’t they?
We don’t despise them in Dorne.
No?
How tolerant of you.
I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei, giving up your regal responsibilities.
Wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked.
I suppose you’ll never know, Prince Oberyn.
It’s a shame your older brother couldn’t attend the wedding.
Please give him our regards.
With any luck, the gout will abate with time and he will be able to walk again.
They call it the rich man’s disease.
A wonder you don’t have it.
Noblemen in my part of the country don’t enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in Dorne.
People everywhere have their differences.
In some places, the highborn frown upon those of low birth.
In other places, the rape and murder of women and children is considered distasteful.
What a fortunate thing for you, former Queen Regent, that your daughter Myrcella has been sent to live in the latter sort of place.
Everyone, silence!
Clear the floor.
There’s been too much amusement here today.
A royal wedding is not an amusement.
A royal wedding is history.
Time has come for all of us to contemplate our history.
My lords, my ladies, I give you King Joffrey, Renly, Stannis, Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy!
The War of the Five Kings!
I’m the rightful king.
King in the North!
Yes!
Traitor.
You’re a traitor.
I’m the King of the Seven Kingdoms!
Let the war begin.
Renly, you’re no king.
Away, degenerate.
Careful.
Go on.
I want you to be my prince.
Stannis!
Who’s got the gold now, Stark?
I am the rightful king.
Challenge me, kraken.
Take that.
I’m drowning!
I am the King in the North!
Not wildfire!
Pay each of them gold when this is done.
Yes, my lord.
We’ll have to find another way to thank the King.
Charge!
Ready?
Again.
I am the King in the North!
Charge!
Charge!
Yes!
Your head!
Fine gentlemen.
Well fought.
Here you are.
Champion’s purse.
Though you’re not the champion yet, are you?
A true champion defeats all the challengers.
Surely there are others out there who still dare to challenge my reign.
Uncle.
How about you?
I’m sure they have a spare costume.
One taste of combat was enough for me, Your Grace.
I would like to keep what remains of my face.
I think you should fight him.
This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle.
I speak as a firsthand witness.
Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne.
Be careful, though.
This one is clearly mad with lust.
It would be a tragedy for the King to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night.
A fine vintage.
Shame that it spilled.
It did not spill.
My love, come back to me.
It’s time for my father’s toast.
How does he expect me to toast without wine?
Uncle, you can be my cupbearer seeing as you’re too cowardly to fight.
Your Grace does me a great honour.
It’s not meant as an honour.
Bring me my goblet.
What good is an empty cup?
Fill it.
Kneel.
Kneel before your king.
Kneel.
I said kneel!
Look, the pie.
My Queen.
Wonderful.
My hero.
Can we leave now?
Let’s find out.
Uncle.
Where are you going?
You’re my cupbearer, remember?
I thought I might change out of these wet clothes, Your Grace.
No, you’re perfect the way you are.
Serve me my wine.
Hurry up.
This pie is dry.
Mmm, good.
Needs washing down.
If it please Your Grace, Lady Sansa is very tired.
No.
No, you’ll wait here…
Your Grace?
It’s nothing.
He’s choking!
Help the poor boy.
Idiots, help your king.
Move away!
Joffrey!
CERSEl Help him!
Someone help him!
Joffrey!
Come with me now.
CERSEl Joffrey!
If you want to live, we have to leave.
Don’t touch him!
Joffrey.
Please, Joffrey.
Joffrey, what is it?
Help him!
My son.
He did this.
He poisoned my son, your king.
Take him!
Take him!
Take him!To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
You did this!
We have to leave.
CERSEl Take him!
Where is his wife?
Where’s Sansa?
Find her.
Bar the gates of the city.
Seize every ship in the harbour.
Where is she?
No one leaves the capital!
Get in.
Where are we going?
Somewhere safe.
Up you go, my lady.
You’ll be fine.
You’re stronger than you know.
Lord Baelish?
Petyr.
Are you hurt, my lady?
Good.
I’m sure you’ve had quite a fright.
Rest easy.
The worst is past.
Lord Baelish.
I promised I’d get her to you safely.
Softly, my friend.
Voices carry over water.
I should get back before someone thinks to look for me.
First you’ll want your pay.
Ten thousand, was it?
Ten thousand.
Wait!
Shh.
You don’t want the Queen to hear, do you?
A thousand gold cloaks are searching for you.
And if they found you, how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the King?
I didn’t murder anyone.
I know.
But you must admit, it looks suspicious.
The King who executed your father, who tormented you for years, and you fled the scene of his murder.
Why did you kill him?
Because he was a drunk and a fool, and I don’t trust drunk fools.
He saved me.
Saved you?
My lady, he followed my orders.
Every one of them.
And he did it all for gold.
Money buys a man’s silence for a time.
A bolt in the heart buys it forever.
He was helping me because I saved his life.
Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace that once belonged to his grandmother.
The last legacy of House Hollard.
I had it made a few weeks ago.
What did I once tell you about the capital?
“We’re all liars here.
” Come, my lady.
I know you’ve had a difficult day.
But you’re safe now.
I promise you that.
You’re safe with me, sailing home.
So am I the queen?
More than you were with Renly.
Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying.
This would not be an opportune moment to press the issue.
Clawing at his own throat, looking to his mother to make it stop…
It was horrible.
The world is overflowing with horrible things.
But they’re all a tray of cakes next to death.
They brought me your grandfather’s body when he died.
Made me look at it.
What was it like?
They took me to the Great Hall.
There he was.
The man I’d married and suffered to father my children.
A great doughy lump I’d sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings.
There he was, lying on a table.
One of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart.
Another was happiest torturing animals and was poisoned at our wedding feast.
I must be cursed.
Nonsense.
Your circumstances have improved markedly.
You may not have enjoyed watching him die, but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him, I can promise you that.
But I would have been the queen.
Our alliance with the Lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us.
You did wonderful work on Joffrey.
The next one should be easier.
Your brother is dead.
Do you know what that means?
I’m not trying to trick you.
It means I’ll become king.
Yes, you will become king.
What kind of king do you think you’ll be?
A good king?
Mmm.
I think so as well.
You’ve got the right temperament for it.
But what makes a good king?
Hmm?
What is a good king’s single most important quality?
This is hardly the place or the time.
Holiness?
Hmm.
Baelor the Blessed was holy.
And pious.
He built this Sept.
He also named a yearold boy High Septon because he thought the boy could work miracles.
He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful.
Hmm.
Justice.
Mmm.
A good king must be just.
Orys I was just.
Everyone applauded his reforms, nobles and commoners alike.
But he wasn’t just for long.
He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother.
Was that truly just of him?
To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognise?
No.
No.
What about strength?
Yes.
Strength.
King Robert was strong.
He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty.
And he attended three Small Council meetings in years.
He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him.
So, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing.
What do they all lack?
Wisdom.
Yes!
Wisdom is what makes a good king.
Yes.
But what is wisdom?
Hmm?
A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong navy that could one day oppose you.
How do you know which choice is wise and which isn’t?
You’ve any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers?
No.
Of course not.
A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn’t.
You’re young.
A wise young king listens to his counsellors and heeds their advice until he comes of age.
And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards.
Your brother was not a wise king.
Your brother was not a good king.
If he had been, perhaps he’d still be alive.
Now, as the king, you will have to marry.
Do you understand why?
A king needs a queen.
Yes, but why?
To further the family line.
Do you know how that happens?
Yes.
But has anyone explained the details to you?
I don’t think so.
It’s all relatively straightforward.
How are you?
I’m all right.
You are.
You will be.
I’ll see to that.
Please give the Queen a moment alone with her son.
Yes, my lord.
All of you.
It was Tyrion.
He killed him.
He told me he would.
“A day will come when you think you are safe and happy, “and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth.
” That’s what he said to me.
You saw it.
You saw Joff point at him just before he…
I don’t know what I saw.
Avenge him.
Avenge our son.
Kill Tyrion.
Tyrion’s my brother.
Our brother.
There’ll be a trial.
We’ll get to the truth of what happened.
I don’t want a trial.
He’ll squirm his way to freedom given the chance.
I want him dead.
Please, Jaime.
You have to.
He was our son.
Our baby boy.
You’re a hateful woman.
Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman?
Jaime, not here, please.
Please.
Stop it.
Stop it.
No.
Stop it.
Stop.
Stop.
It’s not right.
It’s not right.
I don’t care.
Don’t.
I don’t care.
Jaime, don’t.
I don’t care.
Gonna rain soon.
Where are we?
Near Fairmarket, I think.
You think?
You don’t have a map?
No.
Maybe we should get one.
Just point out the next map shop you see, and I’ll buy you one.
How far is it to the Eyrie?
Far.
And you’re sure we’re going the right way?
Believe me, girl, I want you there as soon as I can.
Get my gold, be on my way.
Where?
Why do you care?
Might book passage across the Narrow Sea.
Fight as a sellsword.
Second Sons, could be.
Seems like a good fit for me.
I’d like to see Braavos one day.
Why Braavos?
I have friends there.
I doubt it.
Seven blessings to you.
What do you want?
This is my land.
If I’m standing on it, it’s my land.
We were just watering the horses.
We’ll be on our way.
Forgive my father.
He was wounded fighting in the war.
Our cottage burned down while he was gone, and my mother with it.
He’s never been the same.
Which house did he fight for?
The Tullys of Riverrun.
There’s a storm coming.
You’ll be wanting a roof tonight.
There’s fresh hay in the barn.
And Sally here makes rabbit stew just like her mom used to do.
We don’t have much, but any man that bled for House Tully is welcome to it.
We ask the Father to judge us with mercy, accepting our human frailty.
We ask the Mother to bless our crops, so we may feed ourselves and all who come to our door.
We ask the Warrior to give us courage in these days of strife and turmoil.
We ask the Maiden to protect Sally’s virtue and keep her from the clutches of depravity.
You going to do all seven of the fuckers?
Father!
We ask the Smith to strengthen our hands and our backs, so we may finish the work required of us.
We ask the Crone to guide us on our journey from darkness to darkness.
And we ask the Stranger not to kill us in our beds tonight for no damn reason at all.
I’m so sorry.
Really good.
Did you fight at the Twins?
Call that a fight?
Slaughtering livestock more like.
The Red Wedding, they’re calling it.
Walder Frey committed sacrilege that day.
He shared bread and salt with the Starks.
He offered them guest right.
Guest right don’t mean much any more.
It means something to me.
The gods will have their vengeance.
Frey will burn in the seventh hell for what he did.
Things were different when Hoster Tully ruled the Riverlands.
We had good years and bad years, same as anyone, but we were safe.
Now with the Freys, raiders come plundering, steal our food, steal our silver.
I was gonna send Sally north to stay with my brother, but the North’s no better.
The whole country’s gone sour.
You got any ale?
Afraid not.
How can a man not keep ale in his home?
You look like you could really swing that sword.
A real warrior with proper training.
Those raiders wouldn’t stand a chance against you.
How would it be if you stayed on till the new moon?
I could use a man to help with the farm work.
Sally does what she can, but she can’t lift a bale of hay.
And if any thieves came looking for easy pickings, one look at you, I bet they’d run the other way.
Meaning no offence.
What’ll you pay?
I don’t have much.
But I have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits.
Fair wages for fair work?
Fair wages for fair work.
Ahhh!
What did you do?
Get your horse saddled.
You told me you weren’t a thief.
I wasn’t.
He took us in.
He fed us and you…
Aye, he took us in.
He’s a good man, and his daughter makes a nice stew.
And they’ll both be dead come winter.
You don’t know that.
I do.
He’s weak.
He can’t protect himself.
They’ll both be dead come winter.
Dead men don’t need silver.
You’re the worst shit in the Seven Kingdoms.
There’s plenty worse than me.
I just understand the way things are.
How many Starks they got to behead before you figure it out?
Raper.
Horse thief.
Ninthborn son.
Raper.
Thief.
Thief and raper.
There he is, Sam the Slayer.
Going to visit your wildling whore?
She’s not a whore.
No?
Maybe I’ll give her a copper tonight and find out.
They all think I’m lying.
About what?
Killing the White Walker.
You’re not lying.
I’ll never forget the way it screamed.
But you’re the only one that saw it.
And they all think you’re just a…
A what?
A wildling.
My father hated that word.
It’s not a very nice word.
I don’t know.
It makes me sound a bit dangerous, doesn’t it?
So, are you all right?
No one bothering you?
I get a lot of looks.
I hear them making their jokes.
But no one’s touched me, if that’s what you mean.
I worry about it sometimes.
All the time.
Why do you worry about it?
One hundred men, one woman.
They’ve got other things to think about.
That’s the only thing they think about.
You’re being silly.
I’m not being silly.
There’s men lying awake at night, picturing you.
What about you?
What about me?
Gilly?
I worry about you.
Thank you.
For what?
For worrying about me.
I don’t know if you’re safe here.
They’re my brothers, but some of them were thieves before they came here.
Some of them were rapers.
You saw what they did at your father’s keep.
So what are you saying?
Maybe you’d be safer in Mole’s Town.
Are you bored of me?
Bored of you?
I…
I want to protect you.
I’ll get these to Hobb.
Keep an eye on little Sam.
Your Grace.
You’re a literary man now.
What do you make of that?
Joffrey?
“The usurper, Joffrey Baratheon.
” I said those words when I tossed a leech into the fire, filled with bastard blood.
A bastard you set free.
I am now faced with a great opportunity, and I am powerless to take advantage of it.
I will find you an army, Your Grace.
I’ve been working day and night…
What progress have you made?
I’ve rallied House Peasebury to your cause.
House Peasebury.
House Musgood.
House Musgood.
And House Haigh.
House Haigh.
They don’t have enough men between them to raid a pantry.
Westeros is not the world, Your Grace.
We need to look east for ships and men.
, skilled soldiers fight for the Golden Company.
The Golden Company?
They’ve never broken a contract.
They’re sellswords.
We’re willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne, but we’re not willing to pay men to fight?
Now the Red Woman’s magic is real.
Her visions and prophecies may be, too, but I’ve never heard of visions and prophecies winning a war.
Soldiers win wars.
Soldiers on the ground.
It’s dirty on the ground.
We don’t have any gold.
Not yet.
If I do not press my claim, my claim will be forgotten.
I will not become a page in someone else’s history book.
I’m running out of time, Ser Davos.
Which means you’re running out of time.
You’re late.
I’m sorry, Princess.
I thought you weren’t coming.
The Hand of the King doesn’t have much leisure time.
You won’t be a very good Hand if you see the word knight and say “kanigit.
” That happened once, weeks ago.
You’re your father’s daughter, no mistake.
Bloody relentless, the both of you.
It’s a new one today.
Lots of tricky words.
But I think you can manage.
You’ll never read well if you move your lips.
That’s how children do it.
“The Life and Adventures of Elyo Grivas “First Sword of Braavos.
” Thank you very much.
I like this one.
It’s full of swordfights and pirates.
You were a pirate once.
No, I was a smuggler.
What’s the difference?
If you’re a famous smuggler, you’re not doing it right.
My father says a criminal is a criminal.
Your father lacks an appreciation of the finer points of bad behaviour.
So do the Braavosi.
You’ve sailed to Braavos?
Of course.
Almost got beheaded by a First Sword of Braavos.
I tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers, but he didn’t seem any more interested in the distinction than your father.
I suppose if you work for the Iron Bank of Braavos and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom, you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction…
What was that for?
I need you to write a message.
You should write it yourself.
It’s good practice.
It’s too important for me.
I need a smart person to do it.
Go on.
To the offices of the Iron Bank of Braavos, from Stannis Baratheon, the one true king of Westeros.
But that’s not you.
I need to get their attention.
Go.
Write.
He’s seen some adventures, hasn’t he?
Precious little thing.
Thank you.
What’s his name?
Sam.
Lovely.
That the daddy?
No.
Where’s the daddy?
He’s dead.
Where you from?
North of here.
North of here?
You a fucking wildling?
Only room and board?
That’s right.
She’ll clean and cook and look after the other girls’ babies.
Could find other work for her, too.
No other work.
There’d be money.
Give you a piece of it.
No other work.
I promise to come back and visit whenever I can.
You’ll be safer here.
Who’s gonna protect you at Castle Black?
Me?
You protected me north of the Wall.
This is different.
They’re brothers of the Night’s Watch, and I can’t just stab them in the back.
And I can’t run away, which is what we did at Craster’s.
You have to trust me.
It’s for the best.
Best for you.
Oh, Gilly.
Please don’t…
Greedy.
No?
I’m sorry.
You’re lovely, I just never acquired the taste.
You’re calling my beauty an acquired taste?
That’s quite all right, lover.
There’s more for you.
Your loss.
You like them both the same?
Boys and girls?
Does that surprise you?
Everyone has a preference.
Then everyone is missing half the world’s pleasure.
The gods made that, and it delights me.
The gods made this, and it delights me.
When it comes to war, I fight for Dorne.
When it comes to love, I don’t choose sides.
I hope I have as much stamina when I’m your age.
What are you, ?
Children.
Someday, if you’re lucky, you will wake up and realise you are old.
That pretty ass of yours will sag, your belly will grow soft, and your back will ache in the night, and grey hairs will sprout from your ears.
No one will want you any more.
Make sure you’ve fucked your fill before that day.
Did you?
He is a prince of Dorne.
Girls and boys will line up to fuck him till the day he dies.
They will all have to line up behind you.
Prince Oberyn.
Lord Tywin.
May we have the room?
Call my name if you need me, lover.
Would you like to sit?
No, thank you.
Some wine?
No, thank you.
I’m sorry about your grandson.
Are you?
I don’t believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father.
Or his grandfather.
An awful way to die.
Which way is that?
Are you interrogating me, Lord Tywin?
Some believe the King choked.
Some believe the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blueeyed giant.
The King was poisoned.
I hear you studied poisons at the Citadel.
I did.
This is why I know.
Your hatred for my family is rather wellknown.
You arrive at the capital, an expert in poisoning, some days later my grandson dies of poisoning.
Rather suspicious.
Why haven’t you thrown me in a dungeon?
You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived.
What did you discuss?
You think we conspired together?
What did you discuss?
The death of my sister.
For which you blame me.
She was raped and murdered by the Mountain.
The Mountain follows your orders.
Of course I blame you.
Here I stand unarmed, unguarded.
Should I be concerned?
You are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that.
I am a man of reason.
If I cut your throat today, I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow.
Men at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors’ knowledge.
So you deny involvement in Elia’s murder?
Categorically.
I would like to speak with the Mountain.
I’m sure he would enjoy speaking with you.
He might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would.
I could arrange for this meeting.
But you want something in return.
There will be a trial for my son and, as custom dictates, three judges will render a verdict.
I will preside.
Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge.
I would like you to be the third.
Why?
Not long ago, the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon.
Declared themselves enemies of the throne.
Now they are our strongest allies.
Well, you made the Tyrell girl a queen.
Asking me to judge at your son’s trial isn’t quite as tempting.
I would also invite you to sit on the Small Council to serve as one of the new king’s principal advisors.
I never realised you had such respect for Dorne, Lord Tywin.
We are not the Seven Kingdoms until Dorne returns to the fold.
The King is dead.
The Greyjoys are in open rebellion.
A wildling army marches on the Wall.
And in the east, a Targaryen girl has three dragons.
Before long, she will turn her eyes to Westeros.
Only the Dornish managed to resist Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.
You’re saying you need us?
That must be hard for you to admit.
We need each other.
You help me serve justice to the King’s assassins, and I will help you serve justice to Elia’s.
Podrick.
Apologies for the stench.
I brought you some wine, my lord, but they took it from me.
A noble effort.
They didn’t find the candles, though.
A quill, some parchment, duck sausage, almonds, and some hard cheese.
You’re a good lad.
Any word of Shae?
I’ve heard nothing, my lord.
I suppose that’s a good thing.
What are they saying about me out there?
You’re to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering the King.
Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?
No, my lord.
You didn’t?
Gods, no.
The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it.
I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, I’d plan it in such a way that I wouldn’t be standing there, gawking like a fool when the King died.
Trial in a fortnight.
Have they announced the judges yet?
Your father.
Of course.
Mace Tyrell.
Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote.
And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.
Oberyn?
Give it to my father.
He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.
I’m supposed to get a list of names from you, my lord.
Anyone who might testify on your behalf.
Oh, I can call my own witnesses?
How generous of them.
Very well, my wife.
Sansa.
My lord, she’s gone.
Gone?
No one’s seen her since the wedding.
You don’t think she…
No one had more cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin.
Whoever killed the King wanted me to lose my head for it.
And with my wife’s disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty.
Podrick.
Yes, my lord?
They’ll be following you now.
Who will?
I don’t know.
They.
The ominous they.
The man pulling the strings.
Or woman.
My father.
Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him.
Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle.
Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it’s my sister that had a hand in it.
But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children.
She is the only one I’m certain had nothing to do with this murder.
Which makes it unique as King’s Landing murders go.
Any other witnesses, my lord?
Varys could vouch for me, if he dared.
He’s already been called as a witness for the Queen.
Of course.
Fetch Bronn.
I have a job for him.
I’ve already asked, my lord.
They won’t let him see you.
Why not?
They say he’s a known cutthroat and your close associate.
He’s under investigation himself.
And my brother?
Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?
I’ll ask, my lord.
There’s something else, my lord.
A man, I didn’t know his face, he came to ask if I’d testify against you.
Said I’d be named Ser Podrick Payne if I told the judges you’d bought a poison called the strangler.
Ser Podrick Payne?
Has a nice ring to it.
What did you tell him?
I didn’t tell them anything, my lord.
Are you going to accept their offer?
My lord.
Testifying against me wasn’t a suggestion.
If they can’t tempt you with honey, they’ll choose something less sweet.
You’ve been good to me, my lord.
Pod, the trial’s in a fortnight.
They’ll want an answer before that.
I already gave them an answer, my lord.
I will not have you dying on my behalf.
Do you hear me?
If I have to take that long walk to the executioner’s block, I don’t want to see your head already mounted.
My lord.
Pod, I am giving you an order.
Go and find my brother.
Tell him I need him.
And get yourself out of King’s Landing before it’s too late.
Pod!
This is farewell.
Farewell, my lord.
Pod.
There has never lived a more loyal squire.
Mother says it’s time to eat.
What’s she got boiling?
Wait.
Let me guess.
Potatoes.
No one boils a potato better than your mom.
She got…
The wildlings!
Guymon!
Hide.
Hide!
Run!
You know how to get to Castle Black?
Yes.
Those your parents?
Open your eyes.
I’m going to eat them.
Do you hear me?
I’m going to eat your dead mama and your dead papa.
Go tell the crows at Castle Black.
We need to teach them a lesson about the way we deal with their kind.
Aye!
Aye!
Three dozen bodies with slit throats tossed off the top of the Wall.
Seems like that would be a good lesson.
Aye!
If we go after them, we’ll be giving them what they want.
They want to draw us out, pick us off a few at a time.
We have just over men.
And that’s including stewards and builders.
And me.
We can’t afford to lose a single man.
We must remember our first responsibility.
We are the watchers on the Wall.
There’s got to be a way to protect them.
You’re a champion of the common people, Lord Snow.
What do you say to Brother Pyp’s proposition?
Mance Rayder is coming.
If the wildlings breach the Wall, they’ll roll over everything and everyone for , miles before they reach an army that can stop them.
We need to shore up Castle Black and defend the Wall.
That is our job.
Rangers returning.
Help him.
Thought you’d have blue eyes by now.
What took you so long?
We were held up.
By what?
Chains.
We were guests of the mutineers at Craster’s Keep.
And the mutineers stayed?
They’re not going anywhere.
They’ve got Craster’s food and his wives.
Poor girls.
Never thought they’d miss their daddy.
Karl’s running things now.
He’s the one who put a knife through Craster’s mouth.
We need to ride north and kill them all.
We just went over this, boy.
Justice can wait.
It’s not about justice.
I told the wildlings we had over , men at Castle Black alone.
Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do.
How long do you think they’ll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off?
Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn’t know it yet.
As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will.
Then he’ll throw his full strength at us.
And even if every one of us kills wildlings, there’s still not a thing we can do to stop them.
I don’t think I can kill wildlings.
Are they attacking?
A single rider.
A champion of Meereen.
They want you to send your own champion against him.
What is he doing?
I believe he means to…
He says that we’re an army of men without man parts.
He claims you are no woman at all, but a man who hides his cock in his own arsehole.
Ignore him, Your Grace.
These are meaningless words.
They’re not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them.
I have something to say to the people of Meereen.
First, I will need this one to be quiet.
Do I have a champion?
Allow me this honour, Mother of Dragons.
I will not disappoint you.
You are the commander of the Unsullied.
I cannot risk you.
Your Grace, I’ve won more single combats than any man alive.
Which is why you must remain by my side.
I’ve been by your side longer than any of them, Khaleesi.
Let me stand for you today as well.
You are my most trusted advisor, my most valued general, and my dearest friend.
I will not gamble with your life.
I was the last to join your army.
I’m not your general or a member of your Queensguard or the commander of your Unsullied.
My mother was a whore.
I come from nothing.
I will return to nothing.
Let me kill this man for you.
Very well.
You have quite an audience.
Make it worth their while.
He is very brave, Your Grace.
Yes, win or lose, as long as the whole city is watching.
You sure you don’t want a horse?
Why would I want a horse?
Horses are faster than men.
Horses are dumber than men.
I am Daenerys Stormborn.
Your Masters may have told you lies about me, or they may have told you nothing.
It does not matter.
I have nothing to say to them.
I speak only to you.
First, I went to Astapor.
Those who were slaves in Astapor, now stand behind me, free.
Next I went to Yunkai.
Those who were slaves in Yunkai, now stand behind me, free.
Now I have come to Meereen.
I am not your enemy.
Your enemy is beside you.
Your enemy steals and murders your children.
Your enemy has nothing for you but chains and suffering and commands.
I did not bring you commands.
I bring you a choice.
And I bring your enemies what they deserve.

“My name “is Grey Worm.
“I come from “the Summer Ills.
” MISSANDEl “Isles.
” “Summer Isles.
” “Summer Isles.
” I am from an island called Naath.
When they took you?
When did they take me?
I was five years old.
You remember your home?
I remember when they rowed us away from shore.
How white the beaches were.
How tall the trees.
And I remember my village burning.
Smoke rising into the sky.
Do you remember your home?
Unsullied.
Always Unsullied.
Before Unsullied, nothing.
That’s not true.
Perhaps one day you will return to the Summer Isles.
I don’t want return.
“Kill the masters.
” Kill the masters.
How are the lessons coming?
MISSANDEl Very well, Your Grace.
Missandei is teacher good, my queen.
You’ll have to continue later.
It’s time.
You heard her!
She said she came to free us!
You’re a fool.
The Masters are too strong.
She will protect us.
She defeated the Masters’ champion.
She has a great army.
You want to live the rest of your days in chains?
I want to live.
You saw what they did to those children.
What do you think they’ll do to us?
I’ve been through two slave revolts, boy.
They always end the same way the Masters in power and the slaves dead.
All men must die.
But I promise you, a single day of freedom is worth more than a lifetime in chains.
Who are you?
This one is called Grey Worm.
I was taken as a baby by the Masters of Astapor, raised and trained as Unsullied.
Now I fight for Daenerys, the Mother of Dragons and Breaker of Chains.
You are Unsullied?
They taught you how to fight before you could walk.
We are not soldiers!
We have no training, no weapons.
There are three slaves in this city for every Master.
No one can give you your freedom, brothers.
If you want it, you must take it.
Mhysa!
Mhysa!
Remind me, Ser Jorah, how many children did the Great Masters nail to mileposts?
, Khaleesi.
That was it.
Your Grace, may I have a word?
The city is yours.
All these people, they’re your subjects now.
Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy.
I will answer injustice with justice.
What the hell was that?
That was me knocking your arse to the dirt with your own hand.
You’re a rare talent.
When you’re fighting cripples, anyway.
You learned to fight like a good little boy.
I’ll bet that thrust through the Mad King’s back was pretty as a picture.
You want to fight pretty or you want to win?
You talk to my brother this way?
All the time.
He got used to it.
Do you think he did it?
No.
Oh, he hated the little twat, sure.
But who didn’t?
And poison’s not his style.
Or murder.
You want to know for sure, why don’t you ask him?
You haven’t been to see him yet, eh?
We’re done for today.
Your brother ever tell you how I came into his service?
You stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie.
Aye.
But only when Lady Arryn demanded the trial take place that day.
You were his first choice.
He named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him.
You gonna fight for him now?
To tell you the truth, this isn’t so bad.
Four walls.
A pot to piss in.
I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months.
Is that supposed to make me feel better?
Maybe a bit.
I’m sorry I didn’t come sooner.
It’s complicated.
So how is our sister?
How do you think?
Her son died in her arms.
Her son?
Don’t.
You know what’s coming?
Hmm.
My trial for regicide.
I know the whole bloody country thinks I’m guilty, that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count.
And that judge is my father.
As for Cersei, well, she’s probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed.
She did ask.
So, should I turn around and close my eyes?
Depends.
Did you do it?
The Kingslayer brothers.
You like it?
I like it.
You’re really asking if I killed your son?
Are you really asking if I’d kill my brother?
How can I help you?
You could set me free.
You know I can’t.
Then there’s really nothing else to say.
What do you want me to do?
Kill the guards?
Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart?
I’m the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
Sorry, I’d forgotten.
I’d hate for you to do something inappropriate.
Inappropriate?
You’re accused of killing the King.
Freeing you is treason.
Except I didn’t do it.
Which is why we’re having a trial.
Oh!
A trial.
If the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne, confessed to his crimes, and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt, it wouldn’t matter to Cersei.
She won’t rest until my head’s on a spike.
Not just yours.
She’s offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark.
Sansa couldn’t have done this.
She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms.
Do you think it’s a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?
No, but Sansa’s not a killer.
Not yet, anyway.
Where are you taking me?
I’m getting married to your Aunt Lysa.
She’s waiting for us at the Eyrie.
You’ll be safe there.
Did you kill Joffrey?
Did I kill Joffrey?
I’ve been in the Vale for weeks.
I know it was you.
And who helped me with this conspiracy?
There was Ser Dontos.
You used him to get me out of King’s Landing, but you would never trust him to kill the King.
Why not?
Because you’re too smart to trust a drunk.
Then perhaps it was your husband.
No.
How do you know?
I just do.
You’re right.
He wasn’t involved in Joffrey’s death.
But you were.
Do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you?
I don’t suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast.
The poison.
I don’t understand.
The Lannisters gave you wealth, power.
Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal.
A man with no motive is a man no one suspects.
Always keep your foes confused.
If they don’t know who you are or what you want, they can’t know what you plan to do next.
I don’t believe you.
If they catch you, they’ll put your head on a spike just like my father’s.
You’d risk that just to confuse them?
So many men, they risk so little.
They spend their lives avoiding danger.
And then they die.
I’d risk everything to get what I want.
And what do you want?
Everything.
My friendship with the Lannisters was productive.
But Joffrey, a vicious boy with a crown on his head, is not a reliable ally.
And who could trust a friend like that?
Who could trust you?
I don’t want friends like me.
My new friends are predictable.
Very reasonable people.
As for what happened to Joffrey, that was something my new friends wanted very badly.
Nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong.
I can’t believe you’re going.
Leaving me alone here with these people.
The time has come, my dear.
There’s nothing more tedious than a trial.
Except perhaps these gardens.
If I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens, I’ll fling myself from the cliffs.
Have you been to see Tommen yet?
No.
Have they even agreed to the match?
No one tells me anything.
I wasn’t originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor.
He was engaged to my sister, your greataunt Viola.
I was to be given to some Targaryen or other.
Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then.
But the moment I saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferret’s face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldn’t do.
So the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister, I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber.
How absentminded of me.
Mmmhmm.
The following morning, Luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister ’cause the boy couldn’t bloody walk.
And once he could, the only thing he wanted was what I’d given him the night before.
I was good.
I was very good.
You are even better.
But you need to act quickly.
Cersei may be vicious, but she’s not stupid.
She’ll turn the boy against you as soon as she can.
And by the time you’re married, it’ll be too late.
Luckily for you, the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment.
Mourning her dear departed boy.
Accusing her brother of his murder, which he didn’t commit.
He could have done.
But he didn’t.
You don’t know, Grandmother.
But I do know.
You don’t think I’d let you marry that beast, do you?
What?
I don’t understand.
Shh.
Don’t you worry yourself about all that.
You just do what needs to be done.
Bring it through!
And again.
Very nice.
Good.
A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand.
First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds.
Let’s see what you can do.
OIly, you just watch for now.
I can fight.
Have you ever held a sword before?
I was the best archer in our hamlet.
I was!
I believe you.
We’ll go hunting for rabbits one day.
Right now, watch and learn.
You two.
Take it slow, try and disarm each other.
You know how to fight.
You could have gone easier on him.
He wouldn’t have learned anything that way.
Lord Snow.
What do you think you’re doing?
Grenn and I were helping them.
Grenn’s a ranger.
You’re a steward.
Maybe you forgot that while you were off with your wildling bitch, but I didn’t.
Someone has to train them.
And that someone isn’t you.
Go find a chamber pot to empty.
Go on.
Do it.
You traitor’s bastard.
Give me an excuse.
Mormont’s not here to protect you now.
Get back to work.
Now!
I said now!
The bastard’s wellliked.
You’re not.
You think I care if they like me?
We’re at war.
For now.
But you can’t be acting commander forever.
There will be a choosing.
The old maester will insist on it.
You might reconsider his request to march on Craster’s.
Let the mutineers take care of Snow.
Or you might be taking orders from him the rest of your life.
A bastard, eh?
Took you for highborn.
My father was highborn.
My mother wasn’t.
Name’s Locke.
Jon Snow.
You fight well.
What brought you up here?
A sense of duty.
I wanted to do my part for the safety of the realm.
I was a game warden in the Stormlands.
Fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids.
I was stupid enough to get caught.
Chose the Wall over losing my hand.
Figured I wouldn’t have to suck up to any highborn cunts here.
Come on, get on with it.
What are you waiting for?
Summer?
Guess I was wrong.
You sent for me, Your Grace?
Your Grace.
How formal of you.
How many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommen’s door?
Ser Boros is on duty tonight.
Tomorrow I believe…
So one?
You have one man guarding the future king?
I promise you Tommen’s safe.
We’re protecting him.
The way you protected Joffrey?
Why did Catelyn Stark set you free?
What?
I’ve been wondering for months.
Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital.
Why did she set you free?
You know why.
She’d hoped I’d send her daughters back to her.
She hoped or did you promise?
I swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive, I’d return them to her.
So you made a sacred vow to the enemy.
I wanted to get back to you.
Should I have told her to fuck off?
You didn’t mean it, then?
You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?
Catelyn Stark’s dead.
So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa, if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head, would you do it?
I know you went to see Tyrion.
That creature who murdered our son.
I had to see him.
I had to know for myself.
And?
He didn’t do it, Cersei.
You’ve always pitied him.
Our poor little brother.
Abused by the world, despised by his father and sister.
He’d kill us all if he could.
I want four men at Tommen’s door day and night.
That will be all, Lord Commander.
Ser Pounce?
How did you get past the Kingsguard?
Kingsguard.
I don’t think you’re supposed to be here.
Mother doesn’t allow me to have visitors at night.
I’m not a visitor, Your Grace.
Word has it I’m to be your bride.
Did you know that people in arranged marriages often never meet until their wedding day?
Before we decide to spend our lives together, we ought to get to know one another.
Don’t you think?
Yes.
But if my mother found out…
It can be our secret.
Hmm?
If we’re going to be man and wife, we’ll have a few secrets from her, I hope.
So, Your Grace…
Yes?
Tell me a secret.
Hello.
Aren’t you a proper fellow?
That’s Ser Pounce.
Very handsome.
Joffrey didn’t like him.
He threatened to skin him alive and mix his innards up in my food so I wouldn’t know I was eating him.
That’s very cruel.
You don’t strike me as cruel.
No.
I don’t think I am.
That’s a relief.
Because you know what happens when we marry?
We say our vows in front of the High Septon.
And after the ceremony, there’s a feast.
When we marry, I become yours.
Forever.
It’s getting late.
I should go.
May I come and visit you again?
All right, then.
Remember, our little secret.
“Ser Jaime Lannister.
“Knighted and named to the Kingsguard in his th year.
“At the sack of King’s Landing, murdered his king, Aerys II.
“Pardoned by Robert Baratheon.
“Thereafter known as the Kingslayer.
” It’s the duty of the Lord Commander to fill those pages.
And there’s still room left on mine.
Valyrian steel.
Mmm.
It’s yours.
I can’t accept this.
It was reforged from Ned Stark’s sword.
You’ll use it to defend Ned Stark’s daughter.
You swore an oath to return the Stark girls to their mother.
Lady Stark’s dead.
Arya’s probably dead, too, but there’s still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe.
I’ve got something else for you.
I hope I got your measurements right.
I’ll find her.
For Lady Catelyn.
And for you.
I almost forgot.
I have one more gift.
I don’t need a squire.
Of course you do.
He’ll slow me down.
My brother owes him a debt.
He’s not safe here.
You’ll be keeping him from harm.
It’s chivalry.
I won’t slow you down, ser.
My lady.
I promise I’ll serve you well.
See?
He’s a good lad.
You’ll get along.
Compliments of Lord Tyrion.
His axe from the Blackwater.
What are you waiting for, a kiss?
Ready the lady’s horse.
They say the best swords have names.
Any ideas?
Oathkeeper.
Goodbye, Brienne.
Come on, move.
I should never have taken her away.
She wasn’t safe here.
She’s not safe out there.
I should have known.
You told us there were wildlings south of the Wall.
If they’re raiding the smaller villages, Mole’s Town could be next.
Castle Black could be next.
I should go back for Gilly.
We have orders.
No one’s to leave the castle.
I remember when you disobeyed orders and rode south to help Robb.
And I remember who came after me and brought me home.
I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me.
When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall, all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him.
I wish I could have convinced him to come back with me.
I tried.
Really, I did.
How fast could they travel?
A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton?
I don’t know.
They’d pass wildling villages.
They could try and find shelter at one of them.
The wildlings have joined up with Mance.
Every village or sheltered place will be deserted.
Except…
Craster’s?
You think Bran might have found…
Snow.
I don’t mean to interrupt.
Thorne wants to see you.
Your foray to Craster’s Keep, I’ll sanction it.
But I won’t order anyone to go with you.
Volunteers only.
Thank you, Ser Alliser.
Brothers.
I’m going beyond the Wall to Craster’s Keep to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them.
I’m asking for volunteers to come with me.
There’s miles of wilderness between here and Craster’s, and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this.
Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does.
They know the Wall.
They know our defences.
If Mance learns what they know, we’re lost.
But if that’s not enough, then consider this.
If the Night’s Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father.
He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men.
Stabbed in the back by cowards.
He deserved far better.
All we can give him now is justice.
Who will join me?
I can’t let a recruit come north of the Wall.
Then let me say my vows.
If it’s a fight you’re heading for, then you need men who know how.
Thank you, brothers.
No, don’t.
Don’t, please.
Please don’t.
Ow!
You’re hurting me.
Karl Tanner from Gin Alley drinking wine from the skull of Jeor fucking Mormont.
Any command for us, Lord Commander?
What’s that?
Fuck ’em till they’re dead?
Did you hear that, boys?
Fuck ’em till they’re dead.
Rast.
Go outside and feed the beast.
We should kill that thing.
You should shut your fucking hole, ugly little cunt.
You look like a fucking ballsack.
Ugly.
Look at your stupid cunt face.
I could piss in any gutter and soak five of you.
Know how much they paid me to kill a man in King’s Landing?
Seven silvers.
They told me a man’s name and that man never saw daylight again.
None of them cocksuckers got away from me.
Haven’t lost a fight since I was nine.
Maybe it’s time.
What do you think?
Eh?
Maybe you’re the man.
Eh, cunt?
I wouldn’t stand a chance.
None of us would.
I was a fucking legend in Gin Alley.
A fucking legend!
I would take any knight, any time.
You fucking cunts in steel plate.
Fucking cowards.
A gift for the gods.
A gift for the gods.
What the fuck is that?
Craster’s last child.
A boy.
What am I supposed to do with him?
What did Craster do?
Kill ’em before they could grow up and do the same to him?
All right.
Don’t need another mouth to feed.
Hand him over.
He didn’t kill them.
He offered them.
To who?
To the gods.
The White Walkers.
A gift for the gods.
A gift for the gods.
A gift for the gods.
Shut up!
So, if it worked for him…
…
let’s give the Walkers what they want.
Rast is headed that way.
Pinkeyed fuck.
You thirsty?
Fuck!
Hodor.
Do you hear that?
Is that a baby?
It’s coming.
I’m going out there.
No, we need to stay together.
I’m going.
Bran.
Hodor.
Bran, what happened?
It’s Summer.
He’s hurt.
They’ve caught him in a trap.
Who?
I didn’t see, but they have my brother’s wolf.
They have Ghost.
They’re Night’s Watch.
Look.
Jon might be here.
If Jon was here, why would they put his wolf in a cage?
They might have been Night’s Watch once, not any more.
We’re not safe here.
We need to go.
No.
Bran, we need to go now.
I’m not leaving without Summer.
Can you remember where the cage was?
The east side of the keep.
If I’m not back soon, we’ll meet…
Hodor.
Hodor.
Hodor.
Hodor.
If I was your size, I’d be king of the fucking world.
Help him up.
This is nice.
Fine leather.
You’re no wildling.
Important.
Highborn.
Who are you?
You see, where I come from, a commoner like me slaps a little lord like you, I’d lose me right hand.
But we’re a long way from home, aren’t we?
And then the two of you, fancyIooking folks north of the Wall creeping through the woods.
Isn’t that a bit odd?
I like your curly hair.
My mom had curls like that.
Beautiful brown curls.
Why’d you drag a crippled boy all the way up here?
Hmm?
See, you haven’t played this game before.
A highborn hostage, that’s valuable.
But three of them, that’s a lot of mouths to feed.
What the fuck’s wrong with him?
Come here.
No, please.
Please, let me help him.
Who are you?
Please.
Who are you?
I’m Brandon Stark of Winterfell.
It’s Jon Snow’s brother.
It’s Meera.
I’m right here.
And I thought this was gonna be another boring day.
I’m right here.To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
May the Warrior grant him courage and protect him in these perilous times.
May the Smith grant him strength that he might bear this heavy burden.
And may the Crone, she that knows the fate of all men, show him the path he must walk and guide him through the dark places that lie ahead.
In the light of the Seven, I now proclaim Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.
Long may he reign!
Long may he reign!
Special day.
Your Grace.
Your Grace.
Your Grace.
Your Grace.
There he is.
Long may he reign.
Long may he reign.
He sits the throne like he was born to it.
Yes.
He wasn’t, though, was he?
No, he wasn’t.
You still mourn for Joffrey?
He was my husband.
My king.
He would have been your nightmare.
Your Grace, I feel…
You knew exactly what he was.
I did, too.
You never love anything in the world the way you love your first child.
Doesn’t matter what they do.
And what he did, it shocked me.
Do you think I’m easily shocked?
No.
The things he did shocked me.
He’s only a boy.
A good, decent boy.
He always has been.
Who was the last decent king, I wonder?
He could be the first man who sits on that throne in years to actually deserve it.
It would be some consolation, wouldn’t it?
For all the horror that put him there.
He will need help if he’s going to rule well.
He has you.
A mother is not enough.
You’re still interested in being queen?
After all that’s happened?
It sounds strange, but I am…
I haven’t even given any thought to it, what comes next.
It would be a great honour, of course.
But I will have to speak to my father about it.
Yes, speak to your father.
I’ll speak to mine.
We may be faced with an alarming number of weddings soon.
I won’t even know what to call you.
Sister?
Or Mother?
King Joffrey Baratheon is dead.
Murdered at his own wedding.
And we’ve taken the Meereenese navy, Your Grace.
The Second Sons took the navy.
Who told you to?
No one.
So why did you do it?
I heard you liked ships.
How many ships?
, Your Grace.
How many men can they carry?
,, not counting sailors.
Would that be enough to take King’s Landing?
The Lannisters have more.
They’ve been fighting Joffrey’s wars for years.
They’re tired, dispersed.
And now their king is dead.
, Unsullied, , Second Sons sailing into Blackwater Bay and storming the gates without warning.
It’s hard to say.
It could be enough.
But we’re not fighting to make you queen of King’s Landing.
, men can’t conquer Westeros.
The old houses will flock to our queen when she crosses the Narrow Sea.
The old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win, as they always have.
There’s other news.
From Yunkai.
Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule, the Wise Masters have retaken control of the city.
They’ve reenslaved the freedmen who stayed behind and sworn to take revenge against you.
And in Astapor, the council you installed to rule over the city has been overthrown by a butcher named Cleon who’s declared himself “His Imperial Majesty.
” Please leave me.
Not you, Jorah.
It appears my liberation of Slaver’s Bay isn’t going quite as planned.
You could sail for Westeros and leave it all behind.
A boy sits on the Iron Throne.
A boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it.
They’ve never been more vulnerable.
You counselled me against rashness once in Qarth.
I didn’t listen.
That all worked out well.
How can I rule seven kingdoms if I can’t control Slaver’s Bay?
Why should anyone trust me, follow me?
You’re a Targaryen, the Mother of Dragons.
I need to be more than that.
I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains.
I will not sail for Westeros.
What, then?
I will do what queens do.
I will rule.
Pull up your hood.
A memorable shade.
But how would they know?
You know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most?
Ones about rich girls they’ll never meet.
Is this the only way into the Eyrie?
The mountains are impassable.
If you want to get to the Eyrie, you need to go through the Bloody Gate.
It doesn’t matter how large your army is, if you attack this gate, you do it on this road, three men abreast, and get slaughtered like goats.
The first Lords of the Vale didn’t have much, but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them.
And the fortress they built here has never been overcome.
Not once in , years.
Know your strengths, use them wisely, and one man can be worth ,.
Who would pass the Bloody Gate?
Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece Alayne.
Stand to.
Stand to!
Welcome back, Lord Baelish.
Uncle Petyr!
My lord.
Oh.
I have brought you a gift.
Lord Baelish.
My lady.
Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.
A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy.
It’s a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Arryn.
My name is…
Oh, do take down that hood, child.
Don’t you think I know who you are?
You think I’d let my intended leave the Eyrie on urgent business without knowing what that business was?
I let him go so he could bring you here to me.
My flesh and blood.
It’s wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa.
You mustn’t call me that in front of anyone else.
I understand.
No one can know you’re here.
It would put us in a very precarious position.
I would never say a thing.
The Lannisters want to destroy us.
They’ve been trying for years.
Now they know what it feels like.
Mummy said they killed your mother and they chopped off your brother’s head.
They did, and my father’s.
They killed my father, too, with poison.
I wanted to make the little Lannister baby man fly, but Mother said I couldn’t.
Make him fly?
Through the Moon Door.
And on top of everything else, they made you marry that filthy troll.
They made us both.
Lord Tyrion didn’t want to.
I don’t believe that.
Did he force himself on you?
No.
We never…
Good.
Robin, this is your cousin Sansa.
But you’re not to call her Sansa in front of anyone but Uncle Petyr and myself.
Do you understand?
Sansa, this is my son Robin.
It’s a pleasure to meet you, Robin.
Robin, show Sansa to her chamber.
Take the back stairs.
Go.
We’ll speak soon.
What took you so long?
Arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I, extricating Sansa, getting her here alive.
She’s here.
We’ve spent more than enough time on her for one evening.
Let’s get married tonight.
Ought we not…
…
inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony?
There’s only one Lord of the Vale.
The others can all hang.
Lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards the moment my husband died, trying to get their claws in me.
I do think that we could wait until…
I’m done waiting, Petyr.
We had our wedding night many years ago.
Or don’t you remember?
Like it was yesterday.
What wife would do for you the things I’ve done?
What wife would trust you the way I’ve trusted you?
When you gave me those drops and told me to pour them into Jon’s wine, my husband’s wine.
When you told me to write a letter to Cat telling her it was the…
The deed is done.
Faded into nothing.
Only speaking of it can make it real.
Tonight it is, then.
Let me bathe and dress for the occasion.
Once I’m presentable, I’ll call on the Septon immediately.
I’m warning you.
I’m going to scream when my husband makes love to me.
So loud they’ll hear me clear across the Narrow Sea.
When will the wedding take place in your mind?
CERSEl As soon as decency permits.
After we’ve allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband.
A fortnight?
That seems reasonable.
No jugglers, no jousting dwarves, no course meals.
And your wedding to Loras?
Shortly after Tommen’s.
Shortly?
A fortnight.
I know you don’t like them.
I didn’t like your husband.
Used to pat me on the back a lot.
I didn’t trust him.
We had that in common.
You don’t need to make formal alliances with people you trust.
Then whom can we trust?
Ourselves alone.
The Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side.
Robert wasn’t particularly rich.
Robert had me funding him.
Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.
I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one.
Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?
Haven’t a clue.
Your best guess.
Pounds, tons, ounces?
Doesn’t matter.
The answer is the same.
Can’t be.
Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.
Then how do we pay for anything?
The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.
How much?
A tremendous amount.
There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement.
The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank.
There is no someone.
Someone does work there.
It is comprised of people.
And a temple is comprised of stones.
One stone crumbles and another takes its place.
And the temple holds its form for , years or more.
That’s what the Iron Bank is, a temple.
We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it.
You can’t run from them.
You can’t cheat them.
You can’t sway them with excuses.
If you owe them money and you don’t want to crumble yourself, you pay it back.
Vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal.
It’s for the good of the family, I understand that.
I’m not sure my brothers do.
I know you’re building a strong case against Tyrion.
And as a mother, that is your right.
But as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you.
I respect that.
We don’t need to discuss it.
The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters.
You’ve started wars to protect this family.
Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future.
What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire?
Joffrey.
Cersei.
Walder Frey.
Meryn Trant.
Tywin Lannister.
The Red Woman.
Beric Dondarrion.
Thoros of Myr.
Ilyn Payne.
The Mountain.
Would you shut up?
I can’t sleep until I say the names.
The names of every fucking person in Westeros?
Only the ones I’m going to kill.
Hate’s as good a thing as any to keep a person going.
Better than most.
We come across my brother, maybe we can both cross a name off our list.
If he were here right now, what would you do?
I’d tell him to shut the fuck up so I can get some sleep.
Go on, get it over with, your list of doomed men.
I’m almost done.
Only one name left.
Go on.
The Hound.
Thank you.
Your mother always had a sweet tooth.
Really?
Oh, yes.
At suppertime, she would go straight for honey cakes, candied almonds, custard.
Anything sweet.
Eventually, your grandfather had to assign a septa to watch her at meals.
Cat was the firstborn daughter after all.
It was important that she remain desirable so Father could arrange a good match for her and she was starting to get fat.
My mother fat?
She never let me have my pudding until I’d finished all my proper food.
This is before she married your father and moved to the North.
By the time you were born, your father’s austerity had become hers.
Marriage changes people.
I didn’t mean for you to stop.
Enjoy them.
How do you like them?
They’re delicious.
Where did you get the lemons?
You can’t grow them up here.
Oh, gods, no.
Petyr had three crates brought all the way from King’s Landing.
He knew you liked lemon cakes.
He’s so kind.
He really cares for you.
Think where you’d be without him.
In their clutches, on trial for murder.
Yes.
I’m very lucky.
He feels responsible for you.
Oh, I know he does.
I’m so grateful.
Why?
Why does he feel responsible for you?
Well, I’m half Tully.
He loved your family so much.
Loved your mother.
No.
That’s what you wanted to say.
He loves you, Aunt Lysa.
He’s married to you.
Your mother never loved him.
Cat always went straight for the sweetest thing.
The most obvious thing.
Your Uncle Brandon.
Your handsome, arrogant, cruel Uncle Brandon.
He almost killed Petyr in a duel.
And your mother loved him anyway.
And now Petyr is risking his life to save you, the daughter of a woman who didn’t love him.
No more than those whores in his brothels.
Has he told you about them?
No.
He hasn’t told you about the vile things they do with their bodies, they let him do with their bodies?
Never.
Are you pregnant?
What?
No, I told you.
Lord Tyrion and I never…
I wasn’t asking about Tyrion.
What have you let Petyr do with your body?
Aunt Lysa, no, I…
Your young, pretty body.
Nothing.
I’m a virgin.
Don’t lie to me.
You’re hurting me.
I’ll know if you lie.
I’m a virgin, I swear it.
He loves you, Aunt Lysa.
All he says is that I’m stupid.
I’m a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns, and I’m a terrible liar, so I should always tell the truth.
And I swear to you that he has never touched me.
Not once, not ever.
It’s all right.
It will all be all right.
You’ll be a widow soon.
They’ll execute that dwarf for murdering the king and you’ll be free to marry Robin.
You’ll be the Lady of the Vale.
Hmm.
Didn’t they teach you how to ride a horse?
Yes, my lady, when I was young.
There wasn’t much call for it with Lord Tyrion, though.
He preferred litters.
Perhaps you should have stayed with him.
It’s not going to be a pleasant journey for you.
It could take weeks to get to the Wall, depending on the weather.
That’s a long way off.
Well, Lady Sansa’s brother’s at Castle Black.
If I were her, that’s where I’d go.
Feel free to stop at any point.
Never, my lady.
I’m your squire.
I’ve made it this far in the world without a squire.
I don’t see why I need one now.
All knights have squires, my lady.
I’m not a knight.
And I’m not a slaver, either.
I don’t own you.
I swore an oath, my lady.
I am releasing you from that oath.
That means you could leave.
I know.
What do you think will happen if you leave?
They’ll say I wasn’t a very good squire.
The hell you doing?
Practising.
What, ways to die?
No one’s going to kill me.
They will if you nance around like that.
That’s no way to fight.
It’s not fighting.
It’s water dancing.
Dancing?
Maybe you ought to put on a dress.
Who taught you that shite?
The greatest swordsman who ever lived.
Syrio Forel, the First Sword to the Sealord of Braavos.
Braavos.
Greasyhaired little bastard, I bet.
They all are.
What do you know about anything?
I bet his hair is greasier than Joffrey’s cunt.
It was not.
Was?
He dead?
Yes.
How?
He was killed.
Who by?
Meryn Trant.
That’s why Ser Meryn’s on my…
Meryn Trant?
The greatest swordsman who ever lived killed by Meryn fucking Trant?
He was outnumbered.
Any boy whore with a sword could beat three Meryn Trants.
Syrio didn’t have a sword.
Or armour.
Just a stick.
The greatest swordsman who ever lived didn’t have a sword?
All right.
You have a sword.
Let’s see what he taught you.
Go on, do it for your Braavosi friend.
Dead like all the rest of your friends.
Your friend’s dead and Meryn Trant’s not ’cause Trant had armour and a big fucking sword.
Your Grace.
Prince Oberyn.
Writing letters?
A poem, actually.
May I show you the gardens?
I couldn’t very well refuse a royal escort.
No, you couldn’t.
I didn’t realise you were a poet.
Not a very good one.
For your paramour?
For one of my daughters.
You have several, don’t you?
Eight.
Eight?
Eight daughters?
The fifth is difficult.
I named her after my sister Elia.
Beautiful name.
Yes.
But I can’t say it without turning sad.
And after I turn sad, I grow angry.
Perhaps that’s why she’s difficult.
The gods love their stupid jokes, don’t they?
Which joke is that?
You’re a prince of Dorne.
A legendary fighter.
A brilliant man feared throughout Westeros.
But you could not save your sister.
I’m a Lannister.
Queen for years.
Daughter of the most powerful man alive.
But I could not save my son.
What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?
We can avenge them.
Yes, we can avenge them.
You really believe Tyrion murdered your son?
I know he did.
We will have a trial and we will learn the truth.
We’ll have a trial, anyway.
I haven’t seen my daughter in over a year.
The last time I saw her, she was swimming with two of my girls in the Water Gardens.
Laughing in the sun.
I want to believe that.
I want to believe she’s happy.
You have my word.
We don’t hurt little girls in Dorne.
Everywhere in the world, they hurt little girls.
Would you bring her a gift for me?
I wasn’t there for her nameday.
I don’t know when I’ll see her again.
Anything at all.
The best shipwrights in King’s Landing have been working on it for months.
Myrcella loves the open water.
I will have it sailed down to Sunspear for her.
Please tell her her mother misses her very much.
Oh, no.
No, no.
Hells.
Gods.
Did you remove the skin?
No, my lady.
Have you ever cooked a rabbit before?
No, my lady.
Did you ever cook anything for Lord Tyrion?
No, my lady.
That was the cooks.
What are you doing?
I’m helping you with your armour.
I’ve been removing my own armour for quite some time, thank you very much.
What exactly did you do for Lord Tyrion?
I brought him his meals and cleared his table when he was finished.
I kept his clothing and linens clean.
Carried his messages and returned the replies.
Mostly I poured wine.
Whilst in Lord Tyrion’s service, did you ever do anything remotely related to combat?
I killed a man.
Who?
A Kingsguard.
He tried to kill Lord Tyrion at the Blackwater.
How did you kill a Kingsguard?
I pushed a spear through the back of his head.
Bloody ridiculous.
Help me with these straps.
Hey.
Get up.
Get up.
That’s it, lad, put it inside.
Get the fire going again.
We’re all freezing.
Aye.
We need you in the journey.
I promise I’ll do it.
I’ve got to have a piss.
Now keep quiet.
You need water.
It doesn’t matter.
Of course it matters.
You mustn’t let anything stop you.
They already have stopped me.
No.
You’re not here.
You’re far from here.
What does that mean?
At the hill.
A great weirwood tree.
You’ve seen it, too.
Meera and I, even Hodor, we’re only here to guide you.
He’s waiting for you.
We have to find it.
You have to make it.
We will.
This isn’t the end.
Not for you.
Not yet.
How…
…
will we know the end?
You’ll know.
Brothers.
You do move quiet.
How many?
Eleven men.
Most of them already drunk.
No guards posted.
They don’t seem to have a care in the world.
We’ll carve them up like walnut pie.
Karl was the top paid cutthroat in Flea Bottom.
I’ve seen what he can do with a knife.
Have you seen what I can do with a knife?
Not yet.
There’s a hut on the west side of the keep.
We should steer clear of it.
Why?
They’ve got some hounds chained up inside.
Closer we can get without the dogs sniffing us, the better.
New moon tonight.
Get some rest.
We move at sundown.
I’ve always liked a girl with curls.
A touch of class.
You take whatever’s left.
Get her up.
Stop.
Stop.
What are you doing?
Hodor.
Hodor.
Stop.
Stop!
Hodor.
Stop!
Please.
Hodor.
Please, get off her!
Hodor.
Please, leave her alone!
Please, stop.
Stop.
What are you doing?
Leave her alone!
Hodor.
No!
Shh, shh, shh.
Shh.
You’ve got pretty hair, don’t you?
Now what is a pretty little highborn girl like you doing out here in the deep, dark woods, eh?
You left your daddy’s castle looking for trouble, didn’t you?
No dresses for you.
You like it rough, don’t you?
You like it in the gutter, don’t you?
If you let my sister go, I can help you.
You can help me?
I can.
And how you gonna do that?
I have the sight.
I can see things.
That’s very helpful.
Things that haven’t happened yet.
What a fine thing.
A fine thing.
Have you seen what I’m gonna do to your sister?
What they’re going to do?
No.
Don’t close your eyes.
I saw you die tonight.
I saw your body burn.
I saw the snow fall and bury your bones.
To arms!
They’re here, the Night’s Watch.
Rescue party is here, lads.
Lady.
Is Jon with you?
Aye.
I’ll take you to him.
You’re Brandon Stark?
Hodor.
The little crippled lord.
We’re going for a ride, boy.
Jon!
Keep talking and I’ll cut your friends’ throats.
Starting with the idiot.
Do you hear?
Hodor!
Hodor.
Hodor.
Hodor.
Hodor.
Hodor, get his knife.
Cut me loose.
Hodor, get his knife.
Hodor.
Cut me loose, Hodor.
Jojen and Meera, free them.
Go!
Jon.
Jon!
If he sees you, he won’t let you go north.
He’s my brother.
And wants to protect you.
He’ll take you back to Castle Black.
They’re coming from that way as well!
You have to decide.
Do you want to find the threeeyed raven?
Hodor.
Hodor.
We need to free Summer.
And we need to go.
Lord Snow.
Are you bringing me back for trial?
We had a good thing here.
We were free men.
You’ll never be free.
You’ll never know what that’s like.
You learn how to fight in a castle?
Some old man teach you how to stand, how to parry?
How to fight with honour?
You know what’s wrong with honour?
You.
Are you all right?
Come with me.
Come on.
We lost four brothers?
Five.
What the seven hells could do that to a man?
I count dead mutineers.
Locke said there were of them.
Where’s Rast?
Here’s another.
Jon.
Where in seven hells?
Come here.
I missed you, boy.
What should we do with this lot?
It’s not safe for you here on your own.
Mance Rayder has an army heading this way and there’s worse out there than Mance.
Come with us to Castle Black.
We can find you work.
Keep you safe.
Meaning all respect, ser crow, Craster beat us and worse.
Your brother crows beat us and worse.
We’ll find our own way.
You want to stay here?
In Craster’s Keep?
Burn it to the ground and all the dead with it.To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
Your Grace, if you’d like to sit, I’m sure that…
We’ve been here since midday.
Easterners have a different sense of time.
Once I was waiting for Salladhor Saan here in Braavos.
Together, we were going to run three shiploads of the finest…
Welcome to the Iron Bank.
Please, sit.
What can we do for you, Lord Stannis?
This is Stannis of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
The Iron Throne is currently occupied by Tommen of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.
He shares no blood with me.
He is a bastard born of incest.
As was his brother before him.
Yes.
We have heard this story.
It’s not a story.
It’s the truth.
The king’s grandfather tells a different story.
A story about a jealous uncle whose attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful king cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly in blood and gold.
Gold you loaned him.
And you feel your blood gives you a claim on our gold?
More than any man living.
Across the Narrow Sea, your books are filled with words like “usurper” and “madman” and “blood right.
” Here, our books are filled with numbers.
We prefer the stories they tell.
More plain.
Less open to interpretation.
How many fighting men remain loyal to you?
,.
And how many ships do you have?
Uh…
The ones still afloat, Ser Davos, not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.
Thirtytwo.
And how much wheat and barley and beef and pork do you produce on Dragonstone to feed your , men on your ships?
None.
You can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending from our perspective.
I’m afraid we must respectfully decline your request.
But we thank you for paying us the honour of your visit.
My lord.
I’m not a lord, Ser Davos Seaworth.
You would not be either here.
In Braavos, thieves are not rewarded with titles.
I didn’t do the thieving.
That would be the pirates.
I just moved what they stole from one place to another.
This is the payment that was demanded by King Stannis for my crimes.
I consider it an honest accounting.
He’s an honest man and he’s your best chance to get back the money you’ve sunk into Westeros.
Which is a lot.
Wars are expensive.
The war is over.
As long as Stannis lives, the war is not over.
Who’s the real power in King’s Landing?
Ser Davos…
Humour me.
Tywin Lannister.
How old is Tywin Lannister?
Sixtyseven.
And when he dies, who’s in command?
A halfgrown boy, the product of incest?
Cersei Lannister, a queen whose people despise her?
Jaime Lannister, a man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect?
When Tywin’s gone, who do you back?
That is a problem for another time.
I think it’s a problem for now.
There’s only one reliable leader left in Westeros.
Stannis.
He’s got the birthright.
He’s in his prime.
He’s a tried and tested battle commander.
And he doesn’t just talk about paying people back, he does it.
The lookout sees a pirate ship sailing their way.
The captain shouts to his first mate, “Bring me my red shirt.
” The first mate brings the red shirt and the captain puts it on.
And when the pirates try to board, the brave captain leads his men to victory.
A few days later, the lookout screams, “Two pirate ships!
” The crew is shivering like scared mice.
But the courageous captain hollers, “Bring me my red shirt!
” After the battle, the first mate asks, “Captain, why do you call for your red shirt before battle?
” The captain replies, “So that if I am stabbed, you will not see me bleed.
” The next morning the lookout screams, “Ten pirate ships!
We are surrounded!
” The crew goes silent.
They all look to their brave captain, waiting for his usual command.
Calm as ever, the captain bellows…
“Bring me my brown pants!
” You think they ever met a pirate who didn’t tell them that joke?
Davos.
I heard you were rotting in a dungeon in Dragonstone.
Only half rotted.
Join us, my friend.
This is Lhara.
And this is…
I am Lhara.
She’s an artist, this one, truly.
No time, I’m afraid.
We sail at sunrise.
We?
You, me.
We.
Once I thought this man loved me.
Now I know he despises me.
He wants to see me die poor and alone on some cold…
You won’t be alone.
And you won’t be poor.
There’s a chest of the good stuff left back at your house.
I gave it to your wife.
You’re not my friend, my friend.
I’ll see you at sunrise.
“I give you until the full moon to order all ironborn scum out of the North “and back to those shitstained rocks you call home.
“On the first night of the full moon, “I will hunt down every islander still on our lands “and flay them living, “the way I flayed the ironborn scum I found at Winterfell.
“In the box you’ll find a special gift.
“Theon’s favourite toy.
“He cried when I took it away from him.
“Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon.
” Signed, “Ramsay Snow, “natural born son of Roose Bolton, “Lord of the Dreadfort “and Warden of the North.
” Yes!
They skinned our countrymen and they mutilated my brother, your prince.
Your prince!
Everything they’ve done to him, they’ve also done to you.
Yes!
As long as they can hurt our prince with impunity, the word “ironborn” means nothing.
Go left.
Theon Greyjoy.
I don’t know…
I’m here for Theon Greyjoy.
Take me to the dungeons.
He’s not in the dungeons.
Last cage on the right.
Thank you.
This way!
We’re going home.
No!
It’s all right.
It’s me, Yara.
You can’t trick me.
Tell him you couldn’t trick me.
I’m not tricking you, Theon.
I’m saving you.
Not Theon!
Reek!
My name is Reek!
They’re here.
lf they catch us in here, we’re trapped.
Help me with him.
No, you can’t!
You’re Theon Greyjoy.
No, I don’t believe her!
I know who I am!
I’m Reek!
Loyal Reek!
Good Reek!
I’ve always been Reek!
This is turning into a lovely evening.
I’m Reek!
Loyal Reek!
Theon!
Give me my brother and no more of your men will die.
You’ve got bigger balls than he ever did.
But with those big balls of yours, how fast can you run?
Make for the ship, now.
But your brother?
My brother is dead.
I have a treat for you.
A reward.
Reward?
Yes, Reek.
Those creatures who came in the night, they wanted to take you away.
And you didn’t let them.
You remained loyal.
I didn’t want them to take me.
I was so scared.
I didn’t want them…
Yes, Reek.
It’s a bath.
For you.
Remove those rags.
Now.
The britches, too, Reek.
Take them off.
Do you love me, Reek?
Yes, of course, my lord.
Good.
Because I need you to do something for me.
Something very important.
There’s a castle.
Some bad men hold this castle.
I need your help to take this castle back.
But how can…
I need you to play a role.
To pretend to be someone you’re not.
Pretend to be who?
Theon Greyjoy.
You stand before Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons.
Don’t be afraid, my friend.
The Queen says you may approach and speak.
He is a goatherd.
He says he prayed for your victory against the slave masters.
I thank him for his prayers.
It was your dragons, he says.
They came this morning for his flock.
He hopes he has not offended Your Grace, but now he has nothing.
Tell this man I am sorry for his hardship.
I cannot bring back his goats…
…
but I will see he is paid their value three times over.
Send the next one in.
The noble Hizdahr zo Loraq begs an audience with the Queen.
The noble Hizdahr zo Loraq can speak to me himself.
Queen Daenerys.
Tales of your beauty were not exaggerated.
I thank you.
Mine is one of the oldest and proudest families in Meereen.
Then it is my honour to receive you.
My father, one of Meereen’s most respected and beloved citizens, oversaw the restoration and maintenance of its greatest landmarks.
This pyramid included.
For that, he has my gratitude.
I should be honoured to meet him.
You have, Your Grace.
You crucified him.
I pray you’ll never live to see a member of your family treated so cruelly.
Your father crucified innocent children.
My father spoke out against crucifying those children.
He decried it as a criminal act, but was overruled.
Is it justice to answer one crime with another?
I am sorry you no longer have a father, but my treatment of the masters was no crime.
You’d be wise to remember that.
What’s done is done.
You are the queen and I am a servant of Meereen.
A servant who does not wish to see its traditions eradicated.
And what traditions do you speak of?
Of funeral rite.
Proper burial in the Temple of the Graces.
My father and noble Meereenese are still nailed to those posts, carrion for vultures, rotting in the sun.
Your Grace, I ask that you order these men taken down so that they might receive proper burials.
And what of the slave children these noble Meereenese crucified?
They were rotting in the sun as well.
Would you have begged me for their right to a proper burial?
Your Grace, I cannot defend the actions of the masters.
I can only speak to you as a son who loved his father.
Let me take his body down.
Let me have him brought to the temple and buried with dignity so that he might find peace in the next world.
Bury your father, Hizdahr zo Loraq.
Thank you, my queen.
How many more?
There are supplicants waiting, Your Grace.
?
Send the next one in.
These meetings aren’t always going to be this early, are they?
I was up late last night.
So, does this mean I am a master of something now?
Coins, ships?
Lord Tywin and I already determined that I shall be the Master of Ships long before you…
Lord Tywin, it’s a great honour to have been granted a seat on this council.
I…
The trial begins this afternoon.
We only have the morning for affairs of state.
So, shall we begin?
Sandor Clegane has been spotted in the Riverlands, my lord.
A coward and a traitor.
My birds tell me the Hound slaughtered five of our soldiers.
I believe the phrase “fuck the king” was uttered.
Disgraceful.
What would it take to make the common soldier stupid enough to try his luck with the Hound?
Ten silver stags seems a generous bounty.
Make it .
What else?
More whispers from the east, my lord.
The Targaryen girl?
Daenerys has taken up residence in Meereen.
She has conquered the city and rules as its queen.
Conquered with what?
She commands an army of Unsullied, my queen.
Some , strong.
She has a company of sellswords, the Second Sons.
She has two knights advising her, Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy.
And she has three dragons.
Baby dragons.
Larger every year, Your Grace.
Mormont is spying on her for us.
No longer.
He appears to be fully devoted to her.
As for Ser Barristan, it would seem he took his dismissal from the Kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated.
He’s an old man.
He wasn’t fit to protect my son.
Joffrey didn’t die on his watch.
Dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid.
Don’t tell me you’re worried about a child halfway across the world.
A child with two seasoned warriors counselling her and a powerful army at her back, Your Grace.
Lord Varys is right.
I have been to Essos and seen the Unsullied firsthand.
They are very impressive on the battlefield.
Less so in the bedroom.
Dragons haven’t won a war in years.
Armies win them all the time.
She must be dealt with.
How, my lord?
By force?
Eventually, if it comes to that.
Can your little birds find their way into Meereen?
Most certainly, my Lord Hand.
Mmm.
Lord Tyrell, be a good man.
Fetch my quill and paper.
Prince Oberyn.
Lord Varys.
Only Varys.
I’m not actually a nobleman.
No one is under obligation to call me lord.
And yet everyone does.
You seem quite knowledgeable about the Unsullied.
Did you spend much time in Essos?
Five years.
May I ask why?
‘Tis a big and beautiful world.
Most of us live and die in the same corner where we were born and never get to see any of it.
I don’t want to be most of us.
Most of us aren’t princes.
You are from Essos.
Where?
Lys?
I have an ear for accents.
I’ve lost my accent entirely.
I have an ear for that as well.
Hmm.
How did you get here?
It’s a long story.
One you don’t like telling people.
People I trust.
My paramour Ellaria, she would find you very interesting.
You should come to the brothel and meet her.
We brought our own wine, not the swill they serve here.
We have some lovely boys on retainer, but…
You did like boys before?
Really?
Girls?
Hmm.
I hope you won’t be offended when I say I never would have guessed.
Not at all.
But I was never interested in girls, either.
What then?
Nothing.
Everybody is interested in something.
Not me.
When I see what desire does to people, what it’s done to this country, I am very glad to have no part in it.
Besides, the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things.
Such as?
Let me guess, I’ve been pardoned.
Really?
Father’s orders.
Well, we mustn’t disappoint Father.
Kingslayer!
I, Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of my Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, do hereby recuse myself from this trial.
Tywin of the House Lannister, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm, will sit as judge in my stead.
And with him Prince Oberyn of the House Martell and Lord Mace of the House Tyrell.
And if found guilty, may the gods punish the accused.
Tyrion of the House Lannister, you stand accused by the Queen Regent of regicide.
Did you kill King Joffrey?
No.
Did your wife, the Lady Sansa?
Not that I know of.
How would you say he died, then?
Choked on his pigeon pie.
So you would blame the bakers?
Or the pigeons.
Just leave me out of it.
The crown may call its first witness.
Once we’d got King Joffrey safely away from the mob, the Imp rounded on him.
He slapped the king across the face and called him a vicious idiot and a fool.
It wasn’t the first time the Imp threatened Joffrey.
Right here in this throne room, he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit.
Compared His Grace to the Mad King and suggested he’d meet the same fate.
And when I spoke in the king’s defence, he threatened to have me killed.
Oh, why don’t you tell them what Joffrey was doing?
Silence.
Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her.
Silence!
You will not speak unless called upon.
You’re dismissed, Ser Meryn.
“Basilisk venom, “widow’s blood, “wolfsbane, “essence of nightshade, “sweetsleep, “tears of Lys, “demon’s dance…
” “…
blindeye…
” I think you have made your point, Grand Maester.
You have a lot of poison in your store.
Had, Prince Oberyn.
My stores were plundered.
By whom?
By the accused, Tyrion Lannister, after he had me wrongfully imprisoned.
Grand Maester, you examined King Joffrey’s corpse.
Was it without question poison that killed him?
Without question.
This was found on the body of Dontos Hollard, the king’s fool.
He was last seen spiriting Sansa Stark, the wife of the accused, away from the feast.
She wore this necklace the day of the wedding.
Residue of the most rare and terrible poison was found inside.
Was this one of the poisons stolen from your store?
It was.
The strangler.
A poison few in the Seven Kingdoms possess.
And used to strike down the most noble child the gods ever put on this good earth.
CERSEl “I will hurt you for this.
“A day will come when you think you are safe and happy “and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth “and you will know the debt is paid.
” Your own brother said this to you?
Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay.
I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines.
As it turned out, when the attack came, Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements.
He believed his presence would inspire the troops.
Tyrion said, “And you will know the debt is paid.
” What debt?
I discovered he’d been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand.
I asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behaviour belongs.
He wasn’t pleased.
Thank you, Your Grace, for the courage of your testimony.
Do you remember the precise nature of this threat?
I’m afraid I do, my lord.
He said, “Perhaps you should speak more softly to me, then.
“Monsters are dangerous “and just now kings are dying like flies.
” And he said this to you at a meeting of the Small Council?
Yes.
After we received word of Robb Stark’s death.
He didn’t seem gladdened by the news.
Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause.
You’re excused, Lord Varys.
Father, may I ask the witness one question?
One.
You once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat.
You said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget.
Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?
Sadly, my lord, I never forget a thing.
We will adjourn for now.
Toll the bells in an hour’s time.
Clear the court!
You’d condemn your own son to death?
I’ve condemned no one.
The trial is not over.
This isn’t a trial.
It’s a farce.
Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it.
I know nothing of the sort.
You’ve always hated Tyrion.
He killed his king.
As did I.
Do you know the last order the Mad King gave me?
To bring him your head.
I saved your life so you could murder my brother?
It won’t be murder.
It’ll be justice.
Justice?
I’m performing my sworn duty as Hand of the King.
If Tyrion is found guilty, he will be punished accordingly.
He’ll be executed.
No, he’ll be punished accordingly.
Once you said, “Family is what lives on.
“All that lives on.
” You told me about a dynasty that would last , years.
What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies?
I’m a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line.
I’m well aware.
What happens to your name?
Who carries the lion banner into future battles?
Your nephews?
Lancel Lannister?
Others whose names I don’t even remember?
What happens to my dynasty if I spare the life of my grandson’s killer?
It survives through me.
I’ll leave the Kingsguard.
I’ll take my place as your son and heir if you let Tyrion live.
Done.
When the testimony’s concluded and a guilty verdict rendered, Tyrion will be given the chance to speak.
He’ll plead for mercy.
I’ll allow him to join the Night’s Watch.
In three days’ time, he’ll depart for Castle Black and live out his days at the Wall.
You’ll remove your white cloak immediately.
You will leave King’s Landing to assume your rightful place at Casterly Rock.
You will marry a suitable woman and father children named Lannister.
And you’ll never turn your back on your family again.
You have my word.
And you have mine.
Not going well, is it?
You’re going to be found guilty.
Oh, you think so?
And when you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the Wall.
Father’s agreed to it.
He’ll spare your life and allow you to join the Night’s Watch.
Ned Stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out.
Father is not Joffrey.
He’ll keep his word.
How do you know?
Do you trust me?
Keep your mouth shut.
No more outbursts.
This will all be over soon.
The crown may call its next witness.
State your name.
Shae.
Do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest?
I swear it.
Do you know this man?
Yes.
Tyrion Lannister.
How do you know him?
I was handmaiden to his wife Lady Sansa.
This man stands accused of murdering King Joffrey.
What do you know of this?
I know that he’s guilty.
He and Sansa planned it together.
Silence!
Continue.
She wanted revenge for her father, her mother, her brother.
She blamed their deaths on the king.
Tyrion was happy to help.
He hated Joffrey.
He hated the queen.
He hated you, my lord.
He stole poison from the Grand Maester’s chamber to put in Joffrey’s wine.
How could you possibly know all this?
Why would he reveal such plans to his wife’s maid?
I wasn’t just her maid.
I was his whore.
I beg your pardon?
You said you were his…
His whore.
How did you come to be in his service?
He stole me.
I was with another man, a knight in your lordship’s army.
But when Tyrion arrived at the camp, he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent.
He broke the knight’s arm and brought me to Lord Tyrion.
“You belong to me now,” he said.
“I want you to fuck me like it’s my last night in this world.
” Silence!
And did you?
Did I what?
Fuck him like it was his last night in this world?
I did everything he wanted.
Whatever he told me to do to him.
Whatever he felt like doing to me.
I kissed him where he wanted.
I licked him where he wanted.
I let him put himself where he wanted.
I was his property.
I would wait in his chambers for hours so he could use me when he was bored.
He ordered me to call him “my lion,” so I did.
I took his face in my hands and said, “I am yours and you are mine.
” Shae.
Please don’t.
I am a whore.
Remember?
That was before he married Sansa.
After that, all he wanted was her.
But she wouldn’t let him into her bed.
So he promised to kill King Joffrey for her.
Father, I wish to confess.
I wish to confess.
You wish to confess?
I saved you.
I saved this city and all your worthless lives.
I should have let Stannis kill you all.
Tyrion.
Do you wish to confess?
Yes, Father.
I’m guilty.
Is that what you want to hear?
You admit you poisoned the king?
No, of that I’m innocent.
I’m guilty of a far more monstrous crime.
I am guilty of being a dwarf.
You are not on trial for being a dwarf.
Oh, yes, I am.
I’ve been on trial for that my entire life.
Have you nothing to say in your defence?
Nothing but this…
I did not do it.
I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had.
Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than , lying whores.
I wish I was the monster you think I am.
I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you.
I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.
Ser Meryn.
Escort the prisoner back to his cell.
I will not give my life for Joffrey’s murder.
And I know I’ll get no justice here.
So I will let the gods decide my fate.
I demand a trial by combat.To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
I made a deal for you, to keep your ungrateful head on your neck a little while longer.
I’m sorry, what am I grateful for?
The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit?
You threw your life away.
It’s not a joke.
You understand that, don’t you?
Of course it’s a joke, just not a very funny one.
I couldn’t listen to her standing there, telling her lies.
I couldn’t do it.
You fell in love with a whore.
Yes.
And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me.
That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted.
You do see that?
He gets you back as his heir.
The future Lord of the Rock.
And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last.
All so perfect.
It felt good to take that from him.
He knows I’m innocent and he’s willing to sacrifice me anyway.
He’s willing to sacrifice any of us.
Not you.
You’re the golden son.
You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you’ll always be the golden son.
Careful.
I’m the last friend you’ve got.
At least I got to tell them what they really are.
Yes, brilliant speech.
They’ll be talking about it for days to come.
I thought you were a realist.
Didn’t realise you’d die for pride.
Don’t give up on me just yet.
I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren’t there to save me.
I can’t save you this time either.
My training has proved that I can’t beat a stable boy with my left hand.
Where’s your sense of adventure?
Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father’s face when you fall.
Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword.
It is tempting.
Well…
Bronn fought for me once, he’ll do it again.
If he wins, I expect I’ll be in his debt for the rest of my life.
If he wins.
Will you find him for me?
Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion?
I hope it’s Ser Meryn Trant.
I’d enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.
No.
Not Ser Meryn.
Go on, move it.
And you.
Come on.
Mercy.
Please.
Please, mercy.
CERSEl Ser Gregor.
Welcome to the capital.
Thank you for riding here so quickly.
You seem to be in good form.
Who am I fighting?
Does it matter?
Could be food.
Could be soldiers.
You shouldn’t be sitting out here like this.
Where else to sit?
Tried to walk back to me hut, hurt too much.
Then I remembered they burned me hut down.
Who were “they”?
I stopped asking a while ago.
That’s not going to get better.
Doesn’t seem so.
A bad way to go.
Haven’t you had enough?
Of what?
I know.
Time to go.
Take matters into me own hands.
The thought has occurred to me.
So why go on?
Habit.
Nothing could be worse than this.
Maybe nothing is worse than this.
Nothing isn’t better or worse than anything.
Nothing is just nothing.
Who are you?
My name is Arya.
Arya Stark.
You her father?
Her captor.
Bringing her to her aunt for ransom.
A fair exchange, that is.
Always held to the notion of fair exchange in all my dealings.
You give me, I give you.
Fair.
A balance.
No balance any more.
Could I have a drink?
Dying is thirsty work.
Wish it were wine.
So do I.
That’s where the heart is.
That’s how you kill a man.
The fuck you doing?
There’s a price on your head.
Guess that’s what the king does when you tell him to fuck off.
The king’s dead.
He drank poisoned wine at his own wedding.
The bounty on you is for killing Lannister soldiers.
A hundred silver stags.
And you thought you were going to collect it?
Didn’t think very hard, did you?
You were Yoren’s prisoners when he was taking me to the Wall.
He told me he’d fuck me bloody with a stick.
This day’s really not working out the way you planned.
He on your little list?
He can’t be.
I don’t know his name.
What’s your name?
Rorge.
Thank you.
You’re learning.
Rangers returning!
They return!
Rangers returning!
Greetings.
Didn’t think I’d see you again.
All right, Jon?
Welcome back, brother.
Lord Snow.
This is no place for wild beasts.
Lock him away, or I’ll let Hobb throw him in tonight’s stew.
Come on, Ghost.
Mance’s army was closing in on Craster’s Keep when we left.
We saw their campfires from Osric’s Hill.
They’ll reach the Wall before the next full moon.
I’m surprised you didn’t ride over and say hello.
The KingbeyondtheWall is your old friend, isn’t he?
We need to prepare.
We’ve been preparing.
We should seal the tunnel.
Plug it with rocks and ice.
Flood it and let it freeze.
And how would we range north?
We wouldn’t.
Coward!
You would cut off our legs, pluck out our eyes, leave us cowering behind the Wall hoping for the storm to pass?
We can’t defend the gate against , men.
This castle has stood for thousands of years.
The Night’s Watch has defended her for thousands of years.
And in all those centuries, we have never sealed the tunnel.
Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser?
I have.
The tunnel’s gate won’t stop them.
The bars on those gates are four inches thick.
Coldrolled steel.
And they won’t stop them.
Remind me which order you belong to, Lord Snow.
The stewards.
Are the stewards responsible for maintaining the tunnel?
No.
Who would that be?
The builders.
Ah, the builders.
First Builder Yarwyck, Lord Snow here recommends sealing the tunnel, leaving us unable to carry out our duties as sworn brothers of the Night’s Watch.
Do you agree with him?
No.
Given your deep knowledge of the wildling army, Lord Snow, you and Tarly will take night duties atop the Wall until the full moon.
Moving on.
First Builder, we’ll need barrels of pitch brought atop the Wall.
Aye.
My lord.
You have new clothes.
Do you like ’em?
Eh?
Gloves are doeskin.
Softer than a virgin’s thighs.
I sent for you days ago.
I’ve been a bit busy.
Doing what?
My Ionesome bachelor days are over.
I’m to wed Lollys Stokeworth.
Lollys Stokeworth?
She doesn’t strike me as your sort of girl.
I wouldn’t say I had a single sort of girl.
She’s dimwitted.
If I wanted wits, I’d marry you.
When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?
Falyse.
Aye, I did know.
And you understand the rules of inheritance?
Falyse is and barren.
She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.
She does.
Unless she happens to perish before her father.
Then Lollys gets the castle.
What?
Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time.
You and my sister deserve each other.
Why did you bother to come here?
You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, you’d double their price.
Is it two wives you want or two castles?
One of each will do.
But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, it’d better be a damn big castle.
I’m a bit short on castles at the moment.
But I can offer you gold and gratitude.
I have gold.
What can I buy with gratitude?
You might be surprised.
A Lannister always pays his debts.
Your sister’s a Lannister, too.
My wife is heir to Winterfell.
If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name.
I could carve you out a big piece of it.
If and may and could.
It’s bloody cold up north.
Lollys is soft and warm.
And close.
If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, you’d have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink.
Does he frighten you so much?
I’d be a bloody fool if he didn’t frighten me.
He’s freakish big and strong.
And quicker than you’d expect for a man of that size.
Maybe I could take him, dance around until he’s so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow.
But one misstep and I’m dead.
Why should I risk it?
Because you’re my friend.
Aye, I’m your friend.
And when have you ever risked your life for me?
I like you, pampered little shit that you are.
I just like myself more.
I understand.
I’m sorry it has to be this way.
Why are you sorry?
Because you’re an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart?
That’s what I liked about you in the first place.
We had some good days together.
Yes, we did.
What will you do?
I suppose I’ll have to kill the Mountain myself.
Won’t that make for a great song?
I hope to hear them sing it one day.
How did you get in here?
Your door is well guarded, but your window is not.
I swam to an island a mile offshore for these.
Don’t do that again.
Never met a woman who didn’t like wildflowers.
These are my private quarters.
If I want you here, I will summon you.
Forgive me, my queen.
I live to serve you.
Tell me why you’re here.
I came to ask a favour.
I only have two talents in this world.
War and women.
You are staying here in Meereen to rule.
That is a wise decision.
I respect it.
But here in Meereen, I cannot pursue my talents.
I’ve ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killings.
You’ve ordered us to be night watchmen.
And as for women, there are thousands in Meereen you can pursue.
There is only one, and she does not want me.
You swore me your sword.
My sword is yours till the day I die.
So if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets?
I’ll stay in Meereen and patrol the streets.
Send me to kill your enemies.
Any enemy anywhere.
Let me do what I do best.
Very well.
Do what you do best.
Take off your clothes.
Oh.
Come in, my queen.
Please.
I didn’t mean to disturb you, my lady.
You could never.
I just wanted to speak with you before we left.
Could you bring me that vial over there?
The blue one.
No, not that one.
You don’t even want to touch that one.
Next to it.
That’s the one.
When I looked into the flames this morning, the Lord spoke to me.
He said, “Tonight, you will have your last good bath in a long while.
“Make it count.
” A joke.
Not a very good one, I’m afraid.
It was.
I…
Humour isn’t my strength.
That’s because most jokes are lies and you’re devoted to the truth.
If they’re lies, my lady, aren’t they best avoided?
Not always.
Most of these powders and potions are lies.
Deceptions to make men think they witnessed our Lord’s power.
Once they step into his light, they will see the lie for what it was, a trick that led them to the truth.
A pinch of this powder in a bonfire will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky.
And this one creates a black smoke that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear.
And a drop of this in any man’s wine will drive him wild with lust.
Did you use it with Stannis?
No.
Don’t be upset.
Men never crave what they already have.
It’s only flesh.
It needs what it needs.
No act done in service of the Lord can ever be called a sin.
I thank God every day for bringing you to us.
And Stannis to you.
He wants to bring Shireen with us.
I think that would be illadvised.
My daughter has heretical tendencies, as you’re well aware.
I don’t know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me, but whichever the case, she should stay home.
I understand how you feel.
But that is impossible.
Why?
You don’t need powders and potions, my queen.
You don’t need lies.
You are strong enough to look into the Lord’s light and see his truth for yourself.
However harsh it is.
However hard for us to understand.
You don’t need my help, but I will need yours soon.
When we set sail, your daughter must be with us.
The Lord needs her.
Jorah the Andal.
Are you here to see our queen?
She’s in a good mood.
Khaleesi.
You’re here early.
Later than some.
You don’t approve?
It’s not a question of approval, it’s a question of trust.
You neither approve nor trust.
Why would I?
The man’s a sellsword.
Didn’t you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother?
I did.
I trust you.
Daario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands.
How could you ever have faith in a man like that?
I could never have faith in a man like Daario.
That’s why I’ve sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.
You have?
I have.
Without you there to rule, Khaleesi, I fear the masters will simply bide their time, wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control.
That is why I’ve ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai.
The masters tear babies from their mothers’ arms.
They mutilate little boys by the thousands.
They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men.
They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself.
Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts.
The slaves you freed, brutality is all they’ve ever known.
If you want them to know something else, you’ll have to show it to them.
And repay the slavers with what?
Kindness?
A fine?
A stern warning?
It’s tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but there’s good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought.
Let the priests argue over good and evil.
Slavery is real.
I can end it.
I will end it, and those behind it.
I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi.
And now you are helping me show them to freedom.
I wouldn’t be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai.
The man who came to me the other day about burying his father.
Hizdahr zo Loraq?
He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai.
He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen.
He will explain the choice they have before them.
They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one.
Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves.
Tell him I changed my mind.
Yes, Khaleesi.
No.
Tell him you changed my mind.
Rat cunts.
Fucking whore.
You’re doing it wrong.
You need to burn away that horrible bit there.
Otherwise it’s gonna get infected and fester.
I know you don’t like fire, but if you don’t do it right…
No fire.
It’ll only take a second.
It won’t hurt that much.
No fire!
Shut up about it.
About everything.
Thanks to you, I’m a walking bag of silver anywhere the Lannisters hold sway.
Which is everywhere between where we are now and where we’re going.
I’m as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village, getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten.
No reward is worth this much trouble.
Wish I’d never laid eyes on you.
You say your brother gave you that sword.
My brother gave me this.
It was just like you said a while back.
Pressed me to the fire like I was a nice juicy mutton chop.
Why?
Thought I stole one of his toys.
I didn’t steal it.
I was just playing with it.
The pain was bad.
The smell was worse.
But the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it.
My father, who protected him, told everyone my bedding caught fire.
You think you’re on your own?
Let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least.
Bit of comfort never hurt anyone.
We’ve been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks.
I think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night and a hot meal not cooked by you.
Couldn’t agree more, my lady.
Just don’t start expecting silk underclothes.
Not working for your former lord any longer.
Yes, my lady.
Don’t get drunk.
No, my lady.
Can I get you anything else?
No, this will do nicely, thank you.
Kidney pie is wonderful.
Thanks.
I do my best.
A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients.
Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk.
Easy enough.
But the meat, peacetime or not, getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves’ kidneys is not easy.
I mean, some people settle for plain old beef kidneys.
Got no right to cook anything, them.
Oh, and the gravy.
Don’t get me started on the gravy.
Very difficult to get right.
See, a lot of people give up on the gravy.
You cannot give up.
No gravy, no pie.
Simple as that.
That’s nice armour.
Are you a knight?
No.
Oh, it’s just people with armour are usually knights.
Generally speaking.
From King’s Landing, though, aren’t you?
From there myself originally.
Flea Bottom born and bred.
What brings you to these parts?
We’re looking for someone.
Someone in particular?
Maybe they came in here.
A lot of people come in here.
Just the other day we had …
A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty.
Her name is Sansa Stark, but she may be using a different name.
Starks?
What, like them lot from “Winterhell”?
No, ain’t seen anyone like that.
I heard they was all traitors.
Don’t need no traitors in here.
I pledged my life to their mother Catelyn Stark.
I swore to her I’d bring her daughters home.
Sure I can’t get you a bit more kidney pie?
What?
It’s nothing, my lady.
You wouldn’t be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing.
Don’t want to offend, my lady.
Truly, I don’t.
You’re not interesting enough to be offensive.
The Lannisters want Lady Sansa.
The Lannisters have money.
People kill for money.
I don’t think we should be telling people we’re searching for Lady Sansa.
My lady.
My lord.
Could I have a word?
What about?
Not kidney pie.
You seem like a proper lady.
Someone who could be trusted.
I never met no Sansa Stark.
But I know her sister.
Arya.
No one’s seen Arya Stark since her father was beheaded.
She’s presumed dead.
She weren’t when I last spoke to her.
When was that?
Heading up north with the Night’s Watch.
She was all dressed up as a boy.
Like your ladyship, only without the armour.
Going by the name Arry.
So what happened to her?
Well…
The quick version.
The Lannisters took us prisoner.
We escaped.
The Brotherhood took us prisoner.
They sold me to the innkeep.
They were gonna sell Arya to her mother at Riverrun along with another prisoner.
Big ugly fellow.
Foul mouth and a face like a halfburnt ham.
Not friendly.
The Hound.
That’s the one.
If you find her, could you give her this?
She liked the last one I gave her, but, well, this one turned out better.
Um…
You were saying?
Her mother’s dead, grandfather’s dead, Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun.
The Brotherhood isn’t going to Riverrun.
They’ll take her to the Eyrie, my lady.
Why the Eyrie?
Her aunt, Lysa Arryn.
Catelyn Stark’s sister.
She’s Arya’s last living relative with money.
She hates the Lannisters.
Lord Tyrion made sure I knew which house married which and who hated who.
Sansa could be there, too.
Could be.
You sure about this?
No.
I imagined you’d be back at the brothel at this hour.
I did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day.
Mmm.
Do tell.
I’ve got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like.
Your sister.
Oh.
Cersei approached me.
We spoke a great deal about her daughter.
How worried your sister is about her.
She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you.
I think she may have even believed it herself.
Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.
It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions.
It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters.
She desperately wants to see you killed.
She didn’t need to bother you.
It looks as though I’ve taken care of that myself.
The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck.
She’s wanted this for a long time.
Yes, I know.
We met, you and I.
Many years ago.
I think I would have remembered that.
Unlikely.
You had just been born.
Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock.
My first time away from Dorne.
I didn’t like anything about the Rock.
Not the food, not the weather, not your accents.
Nothing.
But the biggest disappointment, you.
You and my family have more in common than you might admit.
The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister.
A head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy.
That would have made things so much easier.
When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us.
Every day we would ask.
Every day she would say, “Soon.
” Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and…
…
she unveiled the freak.
Your head was a bit large, your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw.
No red eye.
No tail between your legs.
Just a tiny pink cock.
We didn’t try to hide our disappointment.
“That’s not a monster,” I told Cersei.
“That’s just a baby.
” And she said, “He killed my mother.
” And she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off.
Until your brother made her stop.
“It doesn’t matter,” she told us.
“Everyone says he will die soon.
“I hope they are right.
“He should not have lived this long.
” Well, sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants.
And what about what I want?
Justice for my sister and her children.
If you want justice, you’ve come to the wrong place.
I disagree.
I’ve come to the perfect place.
I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice.
And all those who have wronged me are right here.
I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane, who killed my sister’s children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her, too.
I will be your champion.
Hello, Robin.
What are you doing?
I’m building my home, Winterfell.
At least I think I am.
I haven’t been back there in a very long time.
Why did you leave?
It’s a long story.
I stay here in the Eyrie.
Mother says it’s dangerous on the roads and I have to keep myself safe because I’m the Lord of the Vale and a very important person.
Yes, you certainly are.
When will you go back?
Probably never.
My family doesn’t live there any more and someone burned it down.
Oh.
Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?
No, I’m afraid not.
It’s not high up in the mountains.
It’s down on the ground.
That sounds dangerous.
How do you make people fly?
We don’t.
What do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you don’t like?
I never did anything with them at all.
Girls didn’t take part in that where I came from.
Well, I’m Lord of the Vale.
When I grow up, I’ll be able to fly anybody who bothers me.
Or you.
When we get married, you can tell me if you don’t like somebody and then we can bring them back here and, whoosh!
Right through the Moon Door.
I like the sound of that.
Let’s put a Moon Door in your Winterfell.
All right.
It can go in here in this big tower.
Be careful.
You’ve ruined it.
Now I’m going to have to rebuild the whole thing.
I didn’t ruin it.
You did.
It was already ruined because it didn’t have a Moon Door.
I was fixing it.
Knocking things down isn’t fixing them.
It’s ruining them.
I didn’t ruin it!
You’re being stupid.
I didn’t ruin it!
Robin, I’m sorry, I…
Children.
I hit him.
Yes, I saw.
I shouldn’t have done that.
No.
His mother should have, a long time ago.
Consider it a step in the right direction.
If he tells Aunt Lysa…
Let me worry about Aunt Lysa.
I was trying to remember what everything looked like.
I’ll never see it again.
A lot can happen between now and never.
If you want to build a better home, first you must demolish the old one.
Why did you really kill Joffrey?
Tell me why.
I loved your mother more than you could ever know.
Given the opportunity, what do we do to those who’ve hurt the ones we love?
In a better world, one where love could overcome strength and duty, you might have been my child.
But we don’t live in that world.
You’re more beautiful than she ever was.
Lord Baelish…
Call me Petyr.
You wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa?
Come here, Sansa.
Do you know how far the fall is?
No.
Neither do I, precisely.
Hundreds of feet.
It’s fascinating what happens to bodies when they hit the rocks from such a height.
The impact breaks them right apart.
Like eggs dropped on the floor.
Sometimes pieces remain intact.
You’ll find the head sitting on its own.
Every hair in place.
Blue eyes staring at nothing.
I know what you did.
I’m so sorry, Aunt Lysa.
I never should have hit Robin.
I promise it won’t happen…
Don’t be coy with me, you little whore.
You kissed Petyr.
I didn’t.
You don’t understand.
I saw you.
You can’t lie to me because I saw it with my own eyes.
He kissed me.
I pulled away.
Liar!
Whore!
He is mine!
My father, my husband, my sister, they all stood between us and now they’re all dead.
That’s what happens to people who stand between Petyr and me.
Look down!
Look down!
Lysa!
Let her go.
You want her?
This emptyheaded child?
Let her go.
She’s just like her mother.
She’ll never love you.
I lied for you.
I killed for you.
Why did you bring her here?
I’ll send her away.
I swear on my life.
I swear to all the gods.
Let her go, Lysa.
Oh, my sweet wife.
My sweet, silly wife.
I have only loved one woman, only one, my entire life.
Your sister.To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
Here we are.
Ready?
The Rains of Castamere.
You fucking deaf?
Same wrong guess every fucking time.
Listen, you cunt.
Oh!
The Bear and the Maiden Fair.
Yes!
There’s a man with an ear.
Too bad you got a hangnail for a cock.
First time I saw you with your breeches down, I thought you were a eunuch.
You’ve seen it, girls.
Like a baby snail peeking out of its shell.
Your baby was crying this morning.
Woke me up.
You hear me?
Yes.
Well, got anything to say?
I’m sorry.
I don’t care if you’re sorry.
Keep that baby quiet, or I will.
Don’t you ever touch him.
Little wildling bitch.
You should have stayed with your own kind.
Are you listening to me?
Shut your mouth.
What?
It’s just an owl, you dumb bitch.
No, it’s not.
Shh.
I should never have left her there.
You couldn’t have known.
Of course I could’ve.
They’ve been raiding the villages close by.
And we just cower in here while they slaughter our brothers.
Our brothers had orders to stay at Castle Black.
So it’s all right, then?
Black Jack and Kegs and Mully chopped to pieces ’cause they broke the rules?
I didn’t say it was all right.
I’m saying they shouldn’t have been there.
We’re pledged to guard the realms of men.
She’s dead because of me.
We can’t even guard Mole’s Town.
We can’t go after them.
You know that.
It’s what they want.
And little Sam.
As if I cut their throats myself.
Maybe she managed to hide herself.
I thought all of you was dead.
You went up north with Mormont and no one came back.
Not for ages.
But then you did.
She survived Craster, and he was the worst shit I’ve ever met.
She survived the long march to the Wall.
She survived a White Walker, for fuck’s sake.
She might have got out.
She might have.
If they hit Mole’s Town, then we’re next.
Mance and his army must be close.
, of them.
And there’s what, of us left?
You counting Black Jack, Kegs, and Mully?
.
How do men stop ,?
Whoever dies last, be a good lad and burn the rest of us.
Once I’m done with this world, I don’t want to come back.
You think he was spying on you?
MISSANDEl No, not spying.
The Dothraki think outsiders are ridiculous taking shame in the naked body.
They make love under the stars for the whole khalasar to see.
Yes, Your Grace.
But you are not Dothraki.
No.
Well, I don’t see why it matters.
Grey Worm isn’t interested.
None of the Unsullied care what’s under our clothes.
He was interested.
What?
I believe he was interested.
When the slavers castrate the boys, do they take all of it?
All of it?
The pillar and the stones.
I don’t know, Your Grace.
Haven’t you ever wondered?
Yes, Your Grace.
Missandei.
I have come to apologise.
You don’t need to apologise.
I hope I didn’t frighten you.
No.
The lessons you give I in Common Tongue, these are precious to I.
“To me.
” To me.
I don’t remember teaching you the word “precious.
” Jorah the Andal, he teaches I…
He teaches me this word.
Do you remember the name you were given at birth?
I remember nothing.
Only Unsullied.
When they cut you, do you remember that?
I’m sorry.
I’m sorry they did that to you.
Why?
Why sorry?
It’s a terrible thing to do to a boy.
If the Masters never cut me, I never am Unsullied.
I never stand in the Plaza of Pride when Daenerys Stormborn orders us to kill the Masters.
I never am chosen to lead the Unsullied.
I never meet Missandei from the island of Naath.
I am sorry I…
For today, I am sorry.
Grey Worm.
I’m glad you saw me.
So am I.
Kraken.
Mmm.
Strong, as long as they’re in the sea.
When you take them out of the water, no bones.
They collapse under their proud weight and slump into a heap of nothing.
You’d think they’d know that.
Unfortunately, they’re not very bright.
What do you tell them?
I’m Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon, heir to the Iron Islands.
And what are you really?
I’m Reek.
Are you sure?
You do look very much like a lord.
Formidable, proud.
I’m Reek.
Until when?
Always.
Forever.
That’s right.
Until you’re rotting in the ground.
Remember what you are and what you’re not.
Bring me Moat Cailin.
No closer.
Who are you?
I’m Kenning, commander of this garrison.
And you say you’re Theon Greyjoy?
Yes.
And why should I believe that?
I was born on Pyke to Balon Greyjoy.
His third and last living son.
I am your prince.
I swear it by the Drowned God.
What is dead may never die.
What is dead may never die.
And if you were my prince, why are you marching with a Bolton army?
Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell.
He sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow ironborn.
And what does Lord Bolton want?
You are fading from sickness, you are badly outnumbered, and you’re hundreds of miles from the sea.
Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold.
Do this, and he will be just and fair with you as he has been with me.
The Boltons will give you safe passage to the Stony Shore.
He wants us to surrender?
My own father, your king, surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon.
I watched him bend the knee.
There was no shame there.
He fought with honour, as did you.
“No shame.
” “Fought with honour.
” I’m sorry, I didn’t hear.
“No shame.
” “Fought with honour.
” Only a whipped dog would speak this way.
Or a woman.
Are you a woman, boy?
You don’t know…
The ironborn will not surrender.
My name is Reek…
You go tell your master that, Theon Greyjoy, or whoever the fuck you are.
Reek.
What in the hell are you muttering?
Reek.
Reek.
If we yield, we live?
Is that what it says on this paper here?
Yes.
Have your men raise the white flag and open the gates.
You’re going home.
You didn’t really think I’d let them go, did you?
It’s fallen out of fashion, flaying.
Sad, but true.
Traditions are important.
Where are we without our history?
Eh?
Yes, my lord.
Will we go home now?
I believe we will.
To our new home.
You have foreign blood, don’t you, Baelish?
A greatgrandfather from Braavos, yes.
I suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally.
Our forebears settled the Vale thousands of years ago.
We’ve fought off invaders ever since.
The beauty of the Vale is matched only by the nobility of its great families.
Lady Arryn often told me that you were her rock, Lord Royce.
She told me nothing about you, Baelish.
But I didn’t need to hear from her.
Moneylender.
Whoremonger.
You’ve been licking Tywin Lannister’s boots so long, it’s a wonder your tongue’s not black.
My lord…
And when Jon Arryn named you Master of Coin, no one cared.
Always been a grubby job.
Why not let a grubby man do it?
But when I heard you were lurking here, fawning over the Lady Arryn…
Lady Arryn invited me.
She and I have been close since childhood.
Yes, we all know how close you were.
Lady Arryn’s predilections were her own affair.
Her death is our affair.
Of course.
Her suicide shattered us all.
She was an odd fish.
Everyone knew that.
But suicide?
She adored that boy of hers.
I don’t see her abandoning him.
Not by choice.
Strange that within days of your arrival, you’ve married Lady Arryn and she’s fallen through the Moon Door.
She was always prone to melancholy.
My lady wasn’t meant for a world as brutal as ours.
We were told there was a witness.
A girl.
A niece of yours, I believe.
A girl with no learning and scattered wits.
I assure you, she would be of no help.
We’d like to speak with her.
Let me fetch her.
No need.
We prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated.
Come closer, child.
You have nothing to fear from us or him.
Lord Baelish here is your uncle?
Your name is Alayne?
Perhaps you would feel more comfortable if Lord Baelish left the room.
My lady…
I wasn’t asking you.
He can stay.
Speak up, girl, you’re not a damn kitchen mouse.
Tell us what you saw.
I’m sorry, Lord Baelish.
I have to tell the truth.
I’ll tell you everything.
Please, Alayne, leave nothing out.
My name is not Alayne.
It’s Sansa Stark, eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark.
Lord Royce, we met when you came to Winterfell.
You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall.
Sansa Stark?
You tell lies right to my face, you little worm?
Lord Baelish has told many lies.
All to protect me.
Since my father was executed, I have been a hostage in King’s Landing.
A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment.
They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp.
I had no friends in King’s Landing, except one.
He saved me.
Smuggled me away when he had the chance.
He knew I’d be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa.
But the Lannisters have friends everywhere.
Even the Vale.
He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name.
Your secret is safe with us, my lady.
Your father grew up right here in these halls.
We hunted together many times.
He was a fine man.
Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa.
You knew her well, my lords, my lady.
She was a troubled woman.
She always loved Lord Baelish.
She told me herself.
From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun, a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack.
She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn.
She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have.
When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish, she was so happy.
For a time.
My aunt was a jealous lady.
She was terrified that Lord Baelish didn’t love her any more.
That he would abandon her for a younger woman.
And then, one day she saw him kiss me.
Lady Sansa.
It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more.
Lord Baelish is my uncle now, by marriage.
He’s always been so kind to me.
I was so happy to be here, to be free.
All because of him.
But my aunt turned on me.
She cursed me.
Called me a whore.
Promised to throw me through the Moon Door.
When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him.
She said she didn’t want to live any more.
She stood on the edge of that Moon Door.
He tried to reason with her, promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was…
It’s not your fault, sweet girl.
It’s not your fault.
You could see it in the way she raised that boy.
Feeding him from her own teats when he was years old.
Lord Royce!
This is hardly the time.
Apologies, my lady.
And to you as well, Baelish.
We treated you a bit harshly.
You want justice, Lord Royce.
I can hardly complain about that.
I want the same.
Not much justice to be meted out in suicide, is there?
For Lysa, no.
But for her son?
Only years ago, the knights of the Vale rode behind Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon.
They fought together to overcome the Mad King.
And since then, Arryn and Royce, Corbray, Waynwood, all the great houses of the Vale watched from the corner.
A timid boy at a tavern brawl.
Are you questioning our courage?
I want to know which side you’re on.
Do you support the Lannisters, the house that executed your friend Ned Stark?
Of course we don’t support the damn Lannisters.
No?
Catelyn Stark begged her sister for support, and Lysa refused.
By staying out of the fray, you’ve allowed Tywin Lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point.
Who stands against him now?
Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish?
Robb Stark is dead.
I’d have you back Robin Arryn, Lord of the Vale.
Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy.
And sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men.
More often they die young.
I adored Lysa with all my heart, but she loved her son so much she became overprotective.
He needs to learn how to swing a sword, how to ride a horse.
Aye, it’s time.
Yes.
Time for him to tour the Vale, to visit all the castles in his domain.
Time for Robin to leave the nest.
Ser Barristan.
Yes?
Who sent you?
Ser Barristan.
Ser Jorah.
Have I forgotten a council meeting?
No.
What’s this?
A royal pardon signed by Robert Baratheon.
You spied on her.
Who gave you this?
Does it matter?
Have you told her?
I wanted to tell you first, mantoman, rather than go behind your back.
Let me speak with her in private.
You’ll never be alone with her again.
Why did the usurper pardon you?
If we could speak alone.
No, speak to me here.
Explain it to me.
Who do you think sent this to Meereen?
Who profits?
This is the work of Tywin Lannister.
He wants to divide us.
If we’re fighting each other, we’re not fighting him.
The pardon was signed the year we met.
Why were you pardoned?
Unless you’re saying this document was forged.
It is not forged.
Why, then?
I sent letters to Varys, the spymaster of King’s Landing.
What was the content of these letters?
Information.
What information?
When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos.
His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo.
When you were married.
When your brother died.
You told him I was carrying Drogo’s child?
I…
Yes or no?
Khaleesi.
Don’t call me that.
Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo’s child?
Yes.
That wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information.
I stopped you from drinking his wine.
Because you knew it was poisoned.
I suspected.
You betrayed me from the first.
Forgive me.
I never meant…
Please, Khaleesi, forgive me.
You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father and stole my brother’s throne…
I have protected you, fought for you, killed for you.
…
and you want me to forgive you?
I have loved you.
Love?
Love?
How can you say that to me?
Any other man, and I would have you executed.
But you, I do not want you in my city dead or alive.
Go back to your masters in King’s Landing.
Collect your pardon, if you can.
Daenerys, please.
Don’t ever presume to touch me again or speak my name.
You have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city.
If you’re found in Meereen past break of day, I’ll have your head thrown into Slaver’s Bay.
Go.
Now.
Moat Cailin is yours, Father.
Walk with me.
Has there been any word from Locke?
No.
Unimportant.
A cripple, a young boy.
None of the northern lords have seen them.
Dead most likely.
Most of the ironborn have fled the North.
Now more will follow, thanks to you.
Tell me what you see.
Moors, fields, hills.
Tell me what you see.
Nothing.
Not nothing.
The North.
Ride miles that way, you’re still in the North.
miles that way.
miles that way.
The North is larger than the other six kingdoms combined.
And I am the Warden of the North.
The North is mine.
Now tell me, what is your name?
Ramsay Snow.
No, not Ramsay Snow.
Open it.
From this day until your last day, you are Ramsay Bolton, son of Roose Bolton, Warden of the North.
You honour me.
I swear I will uphold your name and your tradition.
I will be worthy of you, Father, I promise.
Come, Reek, I’ll be needing a bath.
Yes?
First time I saw you, you were just a child.
A girl from the North come to the capital for the first time.
You’re not a child any longer.
Why did you help me?
They would have thrown you through the Moon Door if they found you guilty.
That’s not an answer.
If they’d have executed you, what would they have done with me?
I don’t know.
Neither do I.
Better to gamble on the man you know than the strangers you don’t?
And you think you know me?
I know what you want.
Do you?
I thought it’d make me happy, but it doesn’t.
Not really.
Nothing makes you happy.
Lots of things make me happy.
Like what?
Killing Polliver, killing Rorge.
So you’re sad because you didn’t get to kill Joffrey yourself, is that it?
At least I could have been there to watch.
I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over.
Aye, nothing in the world beats that look.
You protected him for most of his life.
You think you could have saved him?
I wasn’t the damn winetaster.
Little shit deserved to die, but poison…
Poison’s a woman’s weapon.
Men kill with steel.
That’s your stupid pride talking.
It’s why you’ll never be a great killer.
I’d have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to.
I’d pay good money to see that.
You should have let me burn it.
It’s a fleabite.
That fleabite’s got you walking a lot slower than you used to.
Well, we won’t have to walk too much further.
You really think my aunt will pay for me?
Aye.
I’ve never even met her.
Doesn’t matter.
You’re her blood.
Family, honour, all that horseshit.
It’s all you lords and ladies ever talk about.
I’m not a lady.
Who would pass the Bloody Gate?
The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane.
And his travelling companion, Arya Stark, niece of your lady Lysa Arryn.
Then I offer my condolences.
Lady Arryn died.
Three days ago.
I’ve never left home before, Uncle Petyr.
I’m afraid to leave.
You shouldn’t be.
The Lord of the Vale belongs in the Eyrie, Mother said.
It’s not safe outside.
It wasn’t safe for her inside.
People die at their dinner tables.
They die in their beds.
They die squatting over their chamber pots.
Everybody dies sooner or later.
Don’t worry about your death.
Worry about your life.
Take charge of your life for as long as it lasts.
That is what it means to be Lord of the Vale.
Shall we go?
Wine always helps.
I thank you for it.
Trial by combat.
Deciding a man’s guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces.
Tells you something about the gods.
How much longer?
Soon.
Do you think Oberyn has a chance?
The Red Viper of Dorne.
You don’t get a name like that unless you’re deadly, right?
I’ve never seen him fight.
Oh, he’s going to die.
I’m going to die.
Oberyn believes in himself.
That’s putting it mildly.
What’s the punishment for regicide?
Drawing and quartering?
Hanging?
Breaking at the wheel?
Beheading.
Seems rather ordinary.
And he was my nephew as well, so what is that?
Fratricide is brothers and filicide is sons.
Nepoticide.
That’s the one.
Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide.
There’s no kind of killing that doesn’t have its own word.
Cousins.
You’re right.
There is no word for cousinkilling.
Well done.
Do you remember Cousin Orson?
Orson Lannister?
Of course.
Wetnurse dropped him on his head and left him simple.
Simple?
Used to sit all day in the garden crushing beetles with a rock.
Nothing made him happier.
Nothing made you happier.
You’d think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.
On the contrary.
Laughing at another person’s misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.
The joke wore thin, though.
For you.
You drifted away.
I had other interests.
Yes, other interests.
But I stayed with Orson.
Why?
I was curious.
Why was he smashing all those beetles?
What did he get out of it?
First thing I did was ask him.
“Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?
” He gave me an answer.
“Smash the beetles.
Smash ’em.
” I wasn’t deterred.
I was the smartest person I knew.
Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron.
So I went to Maester Volarik’s library.
Volarik.
Tried to touch me once.
Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons.
Doesn’t seem right.
In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson’s affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter.
So I went back to the source.
I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behaviour.
And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it.
There was something happening there.
His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn’t understand.
But he wasn’t mindless.
He had his reasons.
And I became possessed with knowing what they were.
I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him.
I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of…
And when I wasn’t watching him, I was thinking about him.
Father droned on about the family legacy, and I thought about Orson’s beetles.
I read the histories of Targaryen conquests.
Did I hear dragon wings?
No.
I heard…
And I still couldn’t figure out why he was doing it.
And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason.
Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score.
Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?
I know.
But still it filled me with dread.
Piles and piles of them, years and years of them.
How many countless living, crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt?
In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see.
I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies.
I tried to stop Orson once.
He was twice your size.
He just pushed me aside with a “cuhn” and kept on smashing.
Every day, until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him.
So what do you think?
Why did he do it?
What was it all about?
I don’t know.
Good luck today.
Looks like very light armour.
I like to move around.
You could at least wear a helmet.
You shouldn’t drink before a fight.
You learned this during your years in the fighting pits?
I always drink before a fight.
It could get you killed.
It could get me killed.
Today is not the day I die.
You’re going to fight that?
I’m going to kill that.
He is the biggest man I’ve ever seen.
Size does not matter when you are flat on your back.
Thank the gods.
In the sight of gods and men, we gather to ascertain the guilt or innocence of this…
…
man, Tyrion Lannister.
May the Mother grant them mercy.
May the Father give them such justice as they deserve.
And may the Warrior guide the hand of our champion…
Don’t leave me alone in this world.
Never.
Have they told you who I am?
Some dead man.
I am the brother of Elia Martell.
And do you know why I have come all the way to this stinking shitpile of a city?
For you.
I’m going to hear you confess before you die.
You raped my sister.
You murdered her.
You killed her children.
Say it now, and we can make this quick.
Say it.
You raped her.
You murdered her.
You killed her children.
You raped her!
You murdered her!
You killed her children!
You raped her!
You murdered her!
You killed her children!
Wait.
Are you dying?
No.
You can’t die yet.
You haven’t confessed.
Say it.
Say her name.
Elia Martell.
You raped her.
You killed her children.
Elia Martell.
Who gave you the order?
Who gave you the order?
Say her name!
You raped her!
You murdered her!
You killed her children!
Say her name.
Say it!
Elia Martell.
I killed her children, then I raped her.
Then I smashed her head in like this!
The gods have made their will known.
Tyrion Lannister, in the name of King Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, you are hereby sentenced to death.To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
What was she like?
She had red hair.
Oh?
How big were her feet?
What do you want me to say?
I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone.
To be with someone.
To love someone and have them love you back.
We’re all gonna die a lot sooner than I’d planned.
You’re the closest I’ll ever get to knowing.
So you and Gilly never?
No.
She just had a baby.
And she never offered.
But if she had,you would have?
You’d have broken your vows?
The interesting thing is,our vows never specifically forbid intimate relations with women.
What?
“I shall take no wife.
” Yes, that’s in there.
There’s no denying that.
“I shall father no children.
” It’s very specific.
But what our vows have to say about other activitiesis open to interpretation.
I don’t think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation.
Anyway, there’s nothing for him to interpret.
We didn’t.
So what’s it like?
It’s…
There’s this whole other person.
And you’re wrapped up in them, and they’re wrapped up in you.
And you…
For a little while, you’re more than just you.
You’re…
Well, I don’t know.
I’m not a bleeding poet.
No, you’re really not.
What did I get for it?
An arrow six inches from my heart.
There’ll be arrows for all of us soon.
There will.
They’ve already done the worst thing to me they could ever do.
Go get some sleep, Sam.
I’ll take this watch.
Did I ever tell you about her?
Sheila?
Yes.
That was a night to remember.
Of course, I’d had a good bit to drink.
Her fangs were sharp, but she knew how to use them.
And she was nice and soft down below.
No, she was no ordinary beast.
Many is the man who…
I know you never fucked a bear.
You know you never fucked a bear.
Right now, I don’t want to think about the bear you never fucked.
Right now, all I want to think about iseach one of these arrows finding its way into a crow’s heart.
We could be waiting here a while.
Good.
The longer we wait, the more arrows I’ll have.
They came up here to our landand put up a big wall and said it was theirs.
Then they started hunting us down.
But this time, we’re the ones doing the hunting.
You’ve got a lot to say about killing.
Even more words than arrows.
Back in those villages, I killed just as many of them as you did.
More, I reckon.
Yes, but none of those were your crow lover.
I probably killed him already.
So you’ve said.
And if not,the only thing left of him is gonna be his fun bits hanging around me neck.
More words.
Know what I think you do when you see him?
Serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge.
What, you’ve been thinking about that ginger minge?
Wondering what it tastes like?
Maybe I have.
Jon Snow is mine.
Anyone else tries to kill him,I’ll have an arrow for them.
And not one of your bald friends is fast enough to stop me.
And what is it that couldn’t wait until morning, Tarly?
Maester Aemon.
How did you know…
That it was you?
Who else but Samwell Tarlywould be wasting candles to read in the middle of the night?
Let me help you.
Oh, no need.
I know my way around this library better than any other place in Castle Black.
Thousands of books and no eyes to read them.
Old age is a wonderful source of ironies,if nothing else.
But you didn’t answer my question.
What are you reading?
Maester Faull.
Ah.
The wildlings.
I can assure you that the closest Maester Faullever got to a wildling was this very library.
But what he says about what they do,it’s all true.
It’s exactly what the survivors of their raids report.
Yes, imagine the stories wildlings tell about us.
Love is the death of duty.
I told that to your friend Jon Snow once.
He didn’t listen, and neither did you.
Which is why you’ve abandoned your watch atop the Wallto come here and read about the terrible thingsthat may have happened to the girl you love.
I don’t love her.
Yes, you do.
No.
Yes, you do.
Heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me.
I remember how it sounds.
I was in love once.
You were?
You can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child.
Is it so difficult to imagine thatan old person was once, more or less, like you?
I’m sorry, Maester.
I didn’t mean it like that.
Do you know who I was before I came here?
What I could have been if I’d only said the word?
Of course you do.
I met many girls when I was Aemon Targaryen.
A future king always does.
Some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections.
One of them succeeded.
I was very young.
Who was she?
Ah.
I could tell you everything about her.
Who she was, how we met,the colour of her eyes and the shape of her nose.
I can see herright in front of me.
She’s more real than you are.
We could spend all night trading tales of lost loves.
Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visitthan the prospect of imminent death.
Go to bed, Tarly.
I’m sorry, I can’t open the gate for nobody.
Orders.
You don’t understand.
They killed everyone.
Everyone but my baby.
And they’re out there.
I saw them on my way here.
They may have seen me.
They may have followed me.
Please.
I’m sorry, I can’t.
If they find us out here, you don’t know what they’ll do.
Pyp!
Open the gate.
I can’t.
Sam, is that you?
Yes.
Thorne gave me strict orders to not open the gate.
Oh, Pyp, open the fucking gate!
I never heard you curse before.
Yes, well, best get used to it.
Are you all right?
You’re all right, yeah.
Of course you are, my brave little fella.
It was horrible.
I’m so sorry.
I didn’t know until I got back.
Don’t let them send me away, Sam.
Never.
I know there’s no women allowed.
Anyone who tries to throw you out will be having words with me.
From now on, wherever you go, I go, too.
Get ready!
Man the gate!
Ready yourselves!
Make haste!
Prepare!
Up on the Wall!
Quickly!
Up!
How many are there?
Beyond the trees!
It’s time.
Light them up!
Light them all!
Move!
Pick up the pace!
Come on!
Here we go, boys.
There’s one.
There’s two.
Come on, let’s get the next load.
That’s the last of the oil, Ser Alliser.
, you say?
Yes, ser.
You can say it if you like.
We should have sealed the tunnel while we had the chance,like you suggested.
It was a difficult decision either way, ser.
Do you know what leadership means, Lord Snow?
It means that the person in charge gets secondguessed byevery clever little twat with a mouth.
But if he starts secondguessing himself,that’s the endfor him, for the clever little twats,for everyone.
This is not the end.
Not for us.
Not if you lot do your duty for however long it takes to beat them back.
And then you get to go on hating me,and I get to go on wishing your wildling whore had finished the job.
You’ll be safe down here.
I’ll check on you as soon as I can.
You’re leaving me again?
I’m not leaving you.
You’re going up there and we’re staying down here.
That’s leaving.
You said from now on we’d stay together.
I didn’t mean in the same room.
What are you going to do out there?
Help my brothers.
How?
You’re going to fight the free folk when they come?
They’ll kill you.
In Mole’s Town, they killed everyone.
I can’t just hide here with you while they’re fighting out there.
Why not?
You won’t matter up there.
You will down here.
I am a man of the Night’s Watch, Gilly.
I made a promise to defend the Wall, and I have to keep it,because that’s what men do.
Promise me you won’t die.
I promise you I won’t die.
There’s a lot more wildlings on the other side of the Wall than this side.
We’ve got loads of weapons and things.
It’s the perfect place for us to be.
I’ve never thrown a spear before.
I’ve never held a sword with a proper edge.
This is no place for me to be.
You’re not afraid?
Of course I’m afraid.
There’s a band of wildlings coming to kill us.
If you’re afraid of a band of wildlings,how in seven hells did you manage to kill a White Walker?
I didn’t know I was going to kill it.
But I had to do something.
I didn’t have any choice.
It was going to kill Gilly and take the baby.
If someone had asked me my name right then, I wouldn’t have known.
I wasn’t Samwell Tarly any more.
I wasn’t a steward in the Night’s Watch, or son of Randyll Tarly, or any of that.
I was nothing at all.
And when you’re nothing at all,there’s no more reason to be afraid.
But you’re afraid now?
Yes, well,I’m not nothing any more.
Most of their men are up top.
Didn’t count more thandown here.
Leftovers.
They got a big fat one and a little bony one manning the front.
How high are the walls?
Well, we’ll be up and over before they know what’s happened.
Let’s kill some crows!
Come on!
Come on, brothers!
Archers, nock.
Everyone else, hold.
Grenn, no!
I said nock and hold, you cunts!
Does nock mean draw?
No, ser!
Does fucking hold mean fucking drop?
No, ser!
You all plan to die here tonight?
No, ser!
That’s very good to hear.
Draw!
No, down below!
Draw!
Light them up.
Come on, get up!
They’re attacking the southern gate!
Now?
Now.
I’m going down there.
Brother Slynt, you have the Wall.
What?
What are you fucking waiting for?
Loose!
You heard the man.
Loose!
You, over there.
Did you get one?
No.
Shit, Pyp!
Shit.
Sam.
Yeah?
I think we’re gonna die.
If you keep missing, we will.
Come on!
Brothers!
A hundred generations have defended this castle.
She’s never fallen before.
She will not fall tonight.
Those are Thenns at our walls.
They eat the flesh of the men they kill.
Do you want to fill the belly of a Thenn tonight?
No!
Tonight we fight.
And when the sun rises, I promise you,Castle Black will stand!
The Night’s Watch will stand!
Yes!
With me now!
Now with me!
No discipline.
No training.
Gang of thieves, that’s all this is.
I commanded the City Watch of King’s Landing.
Those men obeyed orders.
We can’t just let them attack the gate.
The bars of those gates are four inches of coldrolled steel.
Those are giants riding mammoths down there!
Do you think your coldrolled steel is gonna stop them?
No such thing as giants.
A story for the children.
Brother Slynt.
We just got word that Ser Alliser needs you below.
You’re the most experienced man he’s got, ser, and he needs you.
Needed below?
Yes.
Archers, nock your arrows!
Nock arrows!
Draw!
Loose!
They won’t summit before dawn.
How do you know that?
Because I’ve made that climb.
I think they’re in a bigger hurry than you were.
Hold the bridge!
Hold, wait for it!
Come on with the rocks!
Nock!
Draw!
Loose!
Down!
No!
To the gate.
Come on, let’s move.
Come on, up there!
It’s gonna open.
I got one right through the heart.
He’s dead.
Oh.
Is it over?
No.
Well, then…
You’re all right.
I’ll get help.
Maester Aemon is coming.
He’s gonna make it all right.
Now.
Now!
The outer gate won’t hold.
Take five men, hold the inner gate.
Aye.
Hold the gate.
If they make it through…
They won’t.
Come on, Hill.
And you, Cooper.
You three, on me!
Come on, you lazy bastards!
Oil.
Oil on the ramp!
Protect the gate!
Get him inside.
Hold that fucking gate!
Hold it!
We need more men down here.
We have to hold the gate.
But we need men here.
Tell Jon.
He’s in command.
Let’s go.
Get me to the top!
You hear me?
Your name’s OIly, right?
Listen to me, OIly.
Get me to the top.
And when we give the signal, bring us back down.
You hear me?
Find a weapon, OIly.
Fight them.
Clear the way!
Let’s go!
Out of the way!
Get out of here!
Cut the rope!
Wait!
No!
We need more archers.
Here I am.
Come on.
Come on.
Quickly.
What are you doing up here?
The wildlings are over the walls.
Ser Alliser’s fallen.
The castle won’t stand much longer.
Edd, you have the Wall.
If they try the mammoths again, drop fire on them.
If the climbers get too high, drop the scythe on them.
Come, brothers.
Now fight with me!
Might as well enjoy our last night, right, boys?
Light the fuckers up!
Nock!
Draw!
Loose!
How are we gonna stop that?
Shotarrows in him already.
You heard Jon.
We hold the gate.
Jon Snow’s not Lord Commander.
We hold the gate!
Mother, save me.
Father, save me.
The gods aren’t down here.
It’s the six of us.
You hear me?
Please.
Night gathers and now my watch begins.
It shall not end until my death.
I shall take no wife, hold no lands,father no children.
I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.
Win no glory.
I shall live and die by my post.
I am the sword in the darkness.
I am the watcher on the walls.
I am the shield that guards the realms of men.
I pledge my life and honour to the Night’s Watchfor this night and all the nights to come!
I don’t want you out there.
You can’t protect me forever.
There won’t be anywhere to hide if the castle falls.
I need him more than I need you.
We need you, boy.
Ha!
Jon Snow.
Hush.
Don’t talk.
Do you remember that cave?
We should have stayed in that cave.
We’ll go back there.
You know nothing, Jon Snow.
Drop the scythe, boys!
Hoist her up.
Hoist her up!
They’ve had enough for one night.
Don’t cheer too loud.
They still outnumber us , to one.
Tormund.
It’s over.
Let it end.
This is how a man ends.
Put him in chains.
We’ll question him later.
I should have thrown youfrom the top of the Wall, boy!
Aye.
You should have.
Whoa, it’s me.
I promised you, didn’t I?
We held them off.
For one night.
This is a great victory.
A great victory?
Mance was testing our defences.
He almost made it through.
And he has more giants.
He has more mammoths.
He has , times as many men.
They’ll hit us again tonight.
Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two, but we’ll never beat them.
Where are we going?
Going to find Mance.
You can’t do that.
No one gave you any orders.
Who’s left to give orders?
The wildling army’s only an army because of Mance.
He unitedwarring tribes.
Without Mance, they lose their leader.
They lose their purpose.
They go back to fighting each other.
Scatter back to their homes.
Without Mance?
You’re going to kill him?
I’m gonna try.
They’ll never let you withinyards of him.
And even if they did, even if you managed to kill him…
They’ll kill me?
If I don’t go, they’ll kill me anyway.
They’ll kill the rest of us, too.
They won’t just kill you.
They’ll boil you, flay you, make it last days.
You’re right.
It’s a bad plan.
What’s your plan?
They held the gate.
Get some brothers down here to help you.
We need to burn the bodies.
Raise the outer gate.
Then lower it again as soon as I’m out.
What are you doing?
I promised Mormont I’d never lose it again.
In case I don’t come back.
Jon.
Come back.To find an individual line, use your browser’s search feature (CTRL+F)
You’re wearing a black cloak again.
I’ve been sent to negotiate with you.
It appears my trusting nature got the better of me.
It’s happened before.
I was hoping your loyalty was real when you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow.
Truly, I was.
The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black.
He made me kill him so you’d trust me.
I was loyal to him and to my Night’s Watch vows.
All your vows?
She wasn’t enough to turn you, eh?
Were you enough to turn her?
She put three arrows in me when I escaped.
Did you see her again at Castle Black?
Yes.
And?
She’s dead.
Your doing?
No.
We’ll drink to her.
Of all the ways I’d kill you, poison would be the last.
Ygritte.
Ygritte.
That’s not wine.
No, it’s a proper northern drink, Jon Snow.
You did well.
Fought hard.
Killed some of our strongest men.
One of our giants went into your tunnel and never came out again.
Mag the Mighty.
He’s dead.
He killed my friend Grenn.
He was their king.
The last of a bloodline that stretches back before the First Men.
Grenn came from a farm.
Mag and Grenn.
Grenn and Mag.
Kullback, could I trouble you for something to eat?
I don’t imagine our guest has eaten anything for quite some time.
So, you’re here to strike a bargain?
Turn your army around and go home.
You know I know you’re low on arrows, you’re low on oil, you’re low on men.
How many are left, ?
I told Tormund and Orell.
We have more than , men.
I showed you everything I had.
The whole army, , strong.
And what did you do?
You fired on us with everything you had.
It wasn’t much.
As soon as I saw that, I sent men to climb the Wall, an unmanned stretch five miles west of here.
A lot of them will die climbing, but most of them will be over by the end of the day.
It’s me being honest with you, Jon Snow, which is more than you’ve ever done for me.
My people have bled enough.
We’re not here to conquer.
We’re here to hide behind your Wall.
Just like you.
We need your tunnel.
Now we both know that winter is coming.
And if my people aren’t south of the Wall when it comes in earnest, we’ll all end up worse than dead.
You want to strike a bargain with me?
Here’s the bargain.
You go back, you open the gates to us, and I swear to you that no one else will die.
Refuse, and we’ll kill every last man at Castle Black.
Ah!
Oh…
That’s why you’re here.
I reckon you could do it before any of them could stop you.
They’d kill you, of course.
They’d kill you slow.
But you knew that when you came in here.
Are you capable of that, Jon Snow?
Killing a man in his own tent when he’s just offered you peace?
Is that what the Night’s Watch is?
Is that what you are?
Riders coming!
Are you attacking us?
No.
It’s like you said, we don’t have the men.
Hold!
To me!
To me!
Stand down!
I said my people have bled enough, and I meant it.
Round them up.
Stay with the horses.
You’re the KingbeyondtheWall?
Do you know who I am?
Never had the pleasure.
This is Stannis Baratheon, the one true king of the Seven Kingdoms.
We’re not in the Seven Kingdoms, and you’re not dressed for this weather.
It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king.
We do not kneel.
I’ll have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall, have nowhere to put them, have nothing to feed them.
I’m not here to slaughter beat dogs.
Their fate depends on their king.
All the same, we do not kneel.
Take these men away.
What’s a man of the Night’s Watch doing in a wildling camp?
I was sent to discuss terms with the KingbeyondtheWall.
You’re speaking to the one true king, boy.
You will address him as “Your Grace.
” I know he’s the king.
My father died for him.
My name is Jon Snow, Your Grace.
I’m Ned Stark’s son.
Your father was an honourable man.
He was, Your Grace.
What do you think he’d have done with him?
I was this man’s prisoner once.
He could have tortured me.
He could have killed me.
But he spared my life.
I think my father would have taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say.
Very well, then.
Take him.
Your Grace.
If my father had seen the things that I’ve seen, he’d also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall.
All of them.
I would suggest milk of the poppy to ease his pain, but he is completely insensate.
Bloody Martells.
The cause appears to be manticore venom.
It is.
The Death’s Head manticore.
I’ve read a great deal about it.
It’s a horrible poison.
Usually Mantari in origin.
Oh!
There’s nothing to be done.
Yes, there is.
May I ask what you think you’re doing?
Saving him.
Your Grace, I wish it were otherwise, but Ser Gregor is beyond saving.
Well, well beyond.
This man is not even a maester, let alone grand maester.
That’s for the best.
No maester knows how to save him.
That is exactly the sort of arrogance that had him expelled from the Citadel, Your Grace.
His curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural.
Rightly so, in my opinion.
You’re dismissed, Grand Maester.
But, Your Grace, this is my laboratory.
Not any more.
But…
You can save him?
Difficult to say, Your Grace.
But if my past work is any guide…
…
we stand a chance.
Do everything you can.
Come to me for anything you need.
Thank you, Your Grace.
You should know, the process may change him somewhat.
Will it weaken him?
Oh, no.
Very well, then.
Not another word.
We’ve been over this.
The matter’s closed.
I’m opening it again.
You were betrothed to Loras Tyrell.
You’re still betrothed to Loras Tyrell.
And you will marry Loras Tyrell as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.
I will not.
Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands.
Tyrion’s sentence will be carried out tomorrow.
You have on several occasions made great claims about your commitment to this family’s future.
Your role in that future is more vital now than it ever was.
I don’t care.
I will stay in King’s Landing where I belong with my son, the king.
When you were nine years old, I was called to the capital.
I decided to take your brother with me and not you.
You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances.
lf you recall…
I’m not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won.
This isn’t going to be one of those times.
Do you think you’ll be the first person dragged into a Sept to be married against her will?
When you marched into the throne room to tell me we’d won the Battle of Blackwater, do you remember?
I was sitting on the Iron Throne with Tommen.
I was about to give him essence of nightshade.
That’s how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away.
Someone awful is coming to take him away.
No.
Joffrey is dead.
Myrcella’s been sold like livestock.
And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy.
My last boy.
Margaery will dig her claws in, you will dig your claws in, and you’ll fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart.
I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen.
And how will you do that?
I’ll tell everyone the truth.
What truth would that be?
You don’t know, do you?
You never believed it.
How is that possible?
What am I saying?
Of course it’s possible.
How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing?
We were right there in front of you, and you didn’t see us.
One real look in the past years at your own children and you would have known.
Known what?
Everything they say is true about Jaime and me.
No.
Your legacy is a lie.
No, no, no, no.
I don’t believe you.
Yes, you do.
CERSEl Jaime.
You won.
One fewer brother.
Must be proud of yourself.
There’s really nothing you wouldn’t do, is there?
For my family, no, nothing.
I would do things for my family you couldn’t imagine.
Tyrion is your family.
He’s not.
You don’t get to choose.
I do.
So do you.
You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world…
Are you really mad enough to blame him for that?
He didn’t decide to kill her.
He was an infant.
A disease doesn’t decide to kill you.
All the same, you cut it out before it does.
What do you decide?
What do you choose?
The things I did to get back to you, to endure all that, only to find you…
I choose you.
Those are words.
Yes.
Like the ones I just said to Father.
I told him.
Told him what?
I told him about us.
You told him?
I told him I won’t marry Loras Tyrell.
I told him I’m staying right here with Tommen, with you.
You think he’ll just accept that?
Go and ask him.
What did you say?
I don’t want to talk about Tywin Lannister.
I don’t choose Tywin Lannister.
I don’t love Tywin Lannister.
I love my brother.
I love my lover.
People will whisper, they’ll make their jokes.
Let them.
They’re all so small, I can’t even see them.
I only see what matters.
Someone will walk in.
I don’t care.
You stand before Daenerys Stormborn, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men.
Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons.
Thank you for seeing me, Your Grace.
My name is Fennesz.
I can speak the Common Tongue, if you wish.
You speak it very well.
Before you freed me, I belonged to Master Mighdal.
I was tutor to his children.
I taught them languages and history.
They know a great deal about your family because of me.
Little Calla is only seven, but she admires you very much.
I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration.
What can I do for you?
When you took the city, the children begged me not to leave the house.
But Master Mighdal and I agreed that I must.
So I lost my home.
Now I live on the streets.
I have outfitted mess halls to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them.
I do not mean to offend, Your Grace.
I went to one of these places.
The young prey on the old, take what they want and beat us if we resist.
My Unsullied will make them safe again in short order, my friend, this I promise you.
Even if they are safe, who would I be there?
What purpose would I serve?
With my master, I was a teacher.
I had the respect and love of his children.
What is it that you want from me?
Your Grace, I ask you to let me sell myself back to Master Mighdal.
You want to return to a man who owned you like a goat or a chair?
Please, Your Grace.
The young may rejoice in the new world you have built for them, but for those of us too old to change, there is only fear and squalor.
I am not alone.
There are many outside waiting to beg the same of you.
I did not take this city to preside over the injustice I fought to destroy.
I took it to bring people freedom.
But freedom means making your own choices.
I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master.
It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year.
Thank you, Your Grace.
Thank you.
The masters will take advantage of this situation.
The men serving them will be slaves in all but name.
Approach, my friend.
I do not understand, my Queen.
I do not understand, my Queen.
The Queen says you may approach.
MISSANDEl I have brought you…
He came from the sky.
MISSANDEl The black one.
The winged shadow.
MISSANDEl He came from the sky and…
MISSANDEl My girl.
My little girl.
What was her name?
MISSANDEl Zala, Your Grace.
How old was she?
Three.
Three.
And still no word of Drogon?
Sailors saw him flying over the Black Cliffs three days ago, my Queen.
Nothing since then.
Meet me at the catacombs.
They came to us from White Harbour and Barrowton, from Fairmarket and King’s Landing, from north and south, from east and west.
They died protecting men, women, and children who will never know their names.
It is for us to remember them.
Our brothers, we shall never see their like again.
And now their watch is ended.
And now their watch is ended.
Your old blind man patched me up.
Why?
He’s sworn to treat all wounded men, friend or foe.
You want me alive so you can torture me?
No one’s gonna torture you.
So how do we die?
Hanging?
Beheading?
Drop us from the top of the Wall?
I don’t know what happens to the prisoners.
Who decides?
I suppose Stannis does.
He your king now?
I don’t have a king.
You spent too much time with us, Jon Snow.
You can never be a kneeler again.
We’re gonna burn the bodies of your dead.
Do you want to say any words over them?
Words?
What kind of words?
Funeral words.
I don’t know how the free folk do it.
Do what?
Say farewell.
The dead can’t hear us, boy.
Snow.
Did you love her?
She loved you.
She told you?
No.
All she ever talked about was killing you.
That’s how I know.
She belongs in the North.
The real North.
You understand me?
We can stop.
We can rest.
We’ll rest with the threeeyed raven.
We’re not going to make it.
We’re already here.
Jojen.
Jojen.
Look, Jojen.
Jojen!
Come on!
Help them!
Now!
Hold on to me!
Hang on!
Hodor.
Hodor.
Help them!
Hodor.
Hodor!
Hodor!
Hodor.
Hodor!
Bran!
Save yourself, now!
Come with me, Brandon Stark.
He is lost.
Come with me or die with him.
Go with them.
They cannot follow us.
The power that moves them is powerless here.
Who are you?
The First Men called us the Children, but we were born long before them.
Come, he waits for you.
You’re the threeeyed raven?
I’ve been many things.
Now I am what you see.
My brother, he led us to you and now he…
He knew what would happen.
From the moment he left, he knew and he went anyway.
How do you know?
I’ve been watching you.
All of you.
All of your lives.
With , eyes and one.
Now you’ve come to me at last, Brandon Stark.
Though the hour is late.
I didn’t want anyone to die for me.
He died so you could find what you have lost.
You’re going to help me walk again?
You will never walk again.
But you will fly.
Podrick.
Podrick.
Where are the horses?
I hobbled them last night.
What sort of hobble?
A figure eight, like you taught me.
If you did it like I taught you, then the horses would be here.
Thieves, maybe?
It’s at least miles to the Eyrie from here.
You’re carrying the saddlebags.
People coming.
You can shit later.
There’s people coming.
Morning.
Morning.
I like your sword.
Are we getting close to the Bloody Gate?
About more miles.
Did you hear that, Podrick?
Only more miles to the Bloody Gate.
Are you a knight?
No.
But you know how to use that sword?
I do.
Does it have a name?
Oathkeeper.
Mine’s Needle.
Good name.
Who taught you how to fight?
My father.
Mine never wanted to.
Said fighting was for boys.
Mine said the same.
But I kept fighting the boys anyway.
Kept losing.
Finally my father said, “If you’re going to do it, you might as well do it right.
” Seven blessings.
I’m Brienne of Tarth.
This is Podrick Payne.
You want something?
That’s Sandor Clegane.
The Hound.
You’re Arya Stark.
I asked if you wanted something.
I swore to your mother I would bring you home to her.
My mother’s dead.
I know.
I wish I could have been there to protect her.
You’re not a Northerner.
No, but I swore a sacred vow to protect her.
Why didn’t you?
She commanded me to bring Jaime Lannister back to King’s Landing.
You’re paid by the Lannisters.
You’re here for the bounty on me.
I’m not paid by the Lannisters.
No?
Fancy sword you’ve got there.
Where’d you get it?
I’ve been looking at Lannister gold all my life.
Go on, Brienne of fucking Tarth.
Tell me that’s not Lannister gold.
Jaime Lannister gave me this sword.
The Bloody Gate is miles.
I swore to your mother by the old gods and the new.
I don’t care what you swore.
Arya!
You heard the girl.
She’s not coming with you.
She is.
You’re not a good listener.
Valyrian steel?
I always wanted some Valyrian steel.
Come with me, Arya.
I’ll take you to safety.
Safety?
Where the fuck’s that?
Her aunt in the Eyrie is dead.
Her mother’s dead.
Her father’s dead.
Her brother’s dead.
Winterfell is a pile of rubble.
There is no safety, you dumb bitch.
You don’t know that by now, you’re the wrong one to watch over her.
And that’s what you’re doing?
Watching over her?
Aye, that’s what I’m doing.
I have no wish to kill you, Ser.
I’m not a knight.
Arya!
Arya!
Arya!
Where is she?
She was just here.
Why weren’t you watching her?
I was watching you.
I thought you might need some help.
Which way, Pod?
Which way did she go?
I think that way.
Arya!
Arya!
You still here?
Big bitch saved you.
I don’t need saving.
No, not you.
You’re a real killer.
With your water dancing and your Needle.
You gonna die?
Unless there’s a maester hiding behind that rock, aye, I’m done.
I’d skin you alive for wine.
Fuck water.
Killed by a woman.
I bet you like that.
Go on, go after her.
She’ll help you.
Going it alone, you won’t last a day out there.
I’ll last longer than you.
You remember where the heart is?
Fuck it.
I’m ready.
Go on, girl.
Another name off your list.
You kept promising me.
I cut down your butcher’s boy.
The ginger.
He was begging for mercy.
“Please, Ser.
Please don’t kill me.
“Please, please.
” Bled all over my horse.
Saddle stunk of butcher’s boy for weeks.
And your sister.
Your pretty sister.
I should have taken her.
That night the Blackwater burned.
I should have fucked her bloody.
At least I’d have one happy memory.
Do I have to beg you?
Do it.
Do it.
Do it.
Kill me.
Kill me!
Kill me!
Kill me!
Oh, get on with it, you son of a whore.
Is that any way to speak about our mother?
What are you doing?
What do you think I’m doing?
A galley’s waiting in the bay bound for the Free Cities.
Who’s helping you?
Varys.
Varys?
You have more friends than you thought.
There’s a locked door at the top of the stairs.
Knock on it twice, then twice again.
Varys will open.
I suppose this is goodbye, then.
Farewell, little brother.
Jaime.
Thank you.
For my life.
Quickly now.
Tywin?
My lion.
I’m sorry.
I’m sorry.
Tyrion.
Put down the crossbow.
Who released you?
Your brother, I expect.
He always had a soft spot for you.
Come, we’ll go and talk in my chambers.
This is how you want to speak to me, hmm?
Shaming your father has always given you pleasure…
All my life you’ve wanted me dead.
Yes.
But you refused to die.
I respect that.
Even admire it.
You fight for what’s yours.
I’d never let them execute you.
Is that what you fear?
I’ll never let Ilyn Payne take your head.
You’re a Lannister.
You’re my son.
I loved her.
Who?
Shae.
Oh, Tyrion.
Put down that crossbow.
I murdered her.
With my own hands.
It doesn’t matter.
Doesn’t matter?
She was a whore.
Say that word again…
And what?
You’ll kill your own father in the privy?
No.
You’re my son.
Now, enough of this nonsense.
I am your son, and you sentenced me to die.
You knew I didn’t poison Joffrey, but you sentenced me all the same.
Why?
Enough.
We’ll go back to my chambers and speak with some dignity.
I can’t go back there.
She’s in there.
You’re afraid of a dead whore?
You shot me.
You’re no son of mine.
I am your son.
I have always been your son.
What have you done?
Quickly.
Trust me, my friend.
I’ve brought you this far.
I want to see the captain.
You’re seeing him.
I want to go north, to the Wall.
No, you don’t.
I can pay.
There is nothing in the North but ice and war and pirates.
I wouldn’t need a cabin.
Please.
I could work scrubbing the floors…
I’m not going north, child.
I’m going home.
Where’s home?
The Free City of Braavos.
Wait.
I have something else.
More silver won’t make a difference.
It’s not silver.
It’s iron.
This…
How did you…
Valar Morghulis.
Valar Dohaeris.
Of course, you shall have a cabin.
